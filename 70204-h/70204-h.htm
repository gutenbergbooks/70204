<h2 class="nobreak" id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Forty-eight years and a half have passed, since
the last drum-beat of the Confederate States was
heard and the furling of their flag forever closed the
most wondrous military tragedy of the ages. Numbers and
character considered, the tribute the South paid to War has
no equal in human records.</p>

<p>Fifteen hundred years ago on the Catalaunian Plain,
where Attila, King of the Huns, styled “The Scourge of God,”
joined battle with the Romans under Oetius, and the Visigoths
led by Thorismund, tradition has it that hundreds of
thousands of dead were left on the field. The men who
followed the cruel and remorseless Attila were a vast horde,
organized for war, with plunder as the highest aim of a
soldier’s life, and the Romans and Visigoths were men who
followed war solely for the opportunity it afforded to enslave,
rob and despoil those they conquered. On both sides the
men who filled the ranks had neither intelligence nor patriotism,
and with each, war was a profession or pastime, devoid
in most cases of any exalted purpose, even the dream of a
conviction, or the faintest gleam of a principle.</p>

<p>If the dead on that fatal field were numbered by the
hundreds of thousands, their demise was a mere incident in
the conflicts which were carried on for no truth, and in their
loss the world suffered but little more than if as many beasts
of burden had been sacrificed on some heathen altar to
appease the God of War.</p>

<p>The American war, in the middle of the nineteenth
century, dealt on both sides with far different materials.
Christianity, liberty, education, culture and refinement had
reached a very high limit on the human scale. When the
North and South faced each other, moved by patriotism and
principle, the legions drawn from the very best materials<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
that the race could offer, with inherited courage, quickened
by personal and social pride, and with memories and traditions
of great military achievements, and ennobled by ancestral
escutcheons of exceeding splendor, there met for battle
such men as the world had never before seen, aligned for
conflict.</p>

<p>Half a century gives time to gather data, to measure
losses, to calculate sacrifices, to weigh difficulties, to figure
results, and to look calmly and justly at the history and the
conduct of what must ever be classed as one of the great
wars of the ages.</p>

<p>The very fact that the South lost lends pathos and sentiment
to the story of what her sons accomplished. As time,
aided by the scrutinizing finger of Truth, points out with
impartial fairness what each did in this gigantic grapple
between two Anglo-Saxon armies, we are enabled, even now,
while thousands of participants remain, to judge, recount
and chronicle with accuracy the most important events that
marked this mighty struggle.</p>

<p>Cavalry played a most important part in the Civil War.
In fact, without this arm of the service, the Confederacy
could not have so long maintained the unequal contest;
nor the Federal Army have prevailed as quickly as was done.
The story of the campaigns of Stuart, Wheeler, Morgan, the
Lees, Forrest, Hampton, Ashby, Mosby, Green, Van Dorn,
Shelby and Marmaduke, and their associates, gave war a new
glamour, opened to chivalry a wider field for operation,
painted to adventurous genius more entrancing visions,
and made the service of men who rode to battle a transcendent
power of which warriors had hitherto not even
dreamed.</p>

<p>So far as has been historically made known, there is no
similar service performed by the cavalry of any period.
General Morgan, with his command, made two distinct
marches of one thousand miles each into a hostile country.
Shelby is reported to have ridden fifteen hundred miles
when he raided into Missouri in September, 1863. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
were times, probably, when Stuart and Hampton and their
associates had fiercer conflict, but the strain was never so
long drawn out and the calls on nerve and muscle and brain
were never so severely concentrated as in these marches of
Morgan and Shelby.</p>

<p>General Wheeler, in his raid around Rosecrans, was
twenty-five days in the rear of the enemy, menaced on every
side, and his men fought with a courage that was simply
transcendent. His marches were characterized by fierce
fighting and covered a more limited territory, but his captures
and his destruction of property have few counterparts.</p>

<p>No fair man, reading the story of General Dick Taylor’s
exploits, in the spring of ’64, can come to any other
conclusion than that he and his men were heroic, of
abundant patience and exhibited almost unlimited physical
endurance.</p>

<p>The same can be said of Forrest. He did not ride so far
as Morgan, Marmaduke or Shelby on a single expedition,
but what he lacked in distance he made in overcoming difficulties
and in the extent and constancy of conflict, and in the
tremendous losses inflicted upon his enemy’s property and
troops.</p>

<p>Shelby’s Raid into Missouri in September, 1863, which
lasted thirty-six days and involved marching fifteen hundred
miles, an average of thirty miles per day, is a story of extraordinary
skill and endurance.</p>

<p>Stuart’s Chickahominy raid around McClellan’s army,
his march to Chambersburg and return, and the Battle of
Fleetwood Hill will ever command the admiration of cavalry
students.</p>

<p>Hampton’s Trevilian campaign, his cattle raid, and the
management of General Lee’s cavalry before Petersburg
point to him as a leader of wondrous enterprise, a soldier of
unbounded daring and a strategist of great ability.</p>

<p>The cavalry generals who have been chosen as the chief
subjects of this book all possessed, in a remarkable degree,
the power of winning the confidence of their followers and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
their loyal support under all circumstances. With Hampton,
men followed wherever he led, they never reasoned why they
should go, they only asked that they be informed as to the
will of their leader. And so it was true of Morgan, Stuart,
Forrest, Shelby and Wheeler. They all had the absolute
trust of their followers. No man beneath them in command
ever questioned their wisdom or their judgment in battle or
march. But when it came to inspiring men with the spirit
of absolute indifference to death and relentlessness in the
pursuit of the enemy, few would deny that Nathan Bedford
Forrest did this more effectively than any leader who was
engaged in the struggle. Generals Lee, Stonewall Jackson,
Albert Sidney Johnson, Joseph E. Johnston always commanded
the respect, devotion, love and admiration of their
soldiers to such an extent that at any time they would have
marched into the very jaws of death, under their leadership;
but those who study the life and the extent of Nathan Bedford
Forrest’s achievements will generally agree that in
inspiring his soldiers to fierce, persistent battle and absolute
indifference in conflict, few, if any, equalled him, none surpassed
him. The conduct of his soldiers at Bryce’s Cross-roads,
where he fought first cavalry and then infantry,
sometimes mounted, most generally on foot, would show
that he could exact from men as superb service as any soldier
who ever led his followers into battle.</p>

<p>This suggestion as to Forrest does not detract from the
glory of any other Confederate leader. We meet this almost
hypnotic influence in many phases of life other than military.
Those who study the actions and characteristics of General
Forrest and who looked upon the faces of the men following
him could but realize that by his bearing, example and
dash he got the best and bravest that it was possible for
human nature in war to give.</p>

<p>Romance, patriotism and love of adventure inspired the
cavalry of the Confederacy to follow their renowned leaders.
No man who has calmly read the stories of the conflicts and
marches of the Army of Northern Virginia, or the Army of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span>
Tennessee, or of the Army of the Trans-Mississippi Department
can fail to be filled with wonder at the duties the
soldiers of these armies so cheerfully and so willingly performed.
Without pay, illy clad and poorly fed, yet they
were always brave. Though hungry in battle they were
always courageous; and in conflict they had only one aim,
and that was to defend their country and destroy its enemies.</p>

<p>There was much in the narratives of the South’s past to
inspire cavalrymen with Lighthorse Harry Lee valor. Their
fathers and grandfathers had ridden with Marion and
Sumpter, had fought with Shelby, Preston, Sevier and
Campbell at King’s Mountain, or had gone with Isaac
Shelby and General Harrison into Canada to fight the Battle
of the Thames, or composed the dragoons who had gone
with Scott and Taylor to Mexico. The boys and young men
of the South had read and reread the accounts of what
these horsemen of the long ago had accomplished, of the
dangers they had faced and the laurels they had won, and
these records of a splendid past filled their hearts with
deepest love of their country, and fired their souls to make
achievements the equal of those of their renowned ancestry.
The most romantic and chivalrous side of both the Revolutionary
War and the War of 1812 had their happenings
with horsemen, and the most of those were either on the
Southern soil or came from the states which sympathized
with the South.</p>

<p>It was this antecedent history that gave such impetus to
the Confederate youth to find, if possible, a place in the cavalry.
The men of the South were not only familiar with the
use of firearms, but a majority of them were skilled horsemen,
and these two things combined brought to the Confederate
cavalry volunteers, active, adventurous, daring, reckless,
vigilant, chivalrous soldiers that were bound to perform the
highest type of military work.</p>

<p>In the American war, cavalry was to change its arms,
the sabre was to be almost entirely eliminated. In its place
was to come the revolver and the repeating rifle, the magazine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
gun and the short Enfield. The holsters were to be abandoned.
Instead, the belt with the six shooters and the sixty
rounds of ammunition. These new cavalrymen were not only
to serve as scouts, but to act as infantry, to cover military
movements, to destroy the lines of communication, to burn
stores, to tear up lines of railway, to gather supplies, to fight
gunboats, capture transports; all these without any equipment
of any kind, except their horses, their arms and some
horse artillery of limited range. In a large part, they were to
feed in the enemy’s country, rely upon their foes for arms
and ammunition. They were to have no tents; no wagons,
except for ammunition; no cooking utensils, other than a
wrought iron skillet. These, with canteens and food found
on the march, were to prove their only means of subsistence.
They were to be trained to ride incessantly, charge stockades,
capture forts, take their place alongside of the infantry on
the battle line, and to build or defend hastily constructed
fortifications. No cavalry before had performed these
services and none will ever perform them again. The newer
conditions of warfare will change altogether the work that
will be required of cavalry. The improvement in firearms,
particularly in the artillery, would render the oldtime cavalry
superfluous and its use, under the past methods, a simple
slaughter without benefit.</p>

<p>These men, carried by horses with great celerity from
place to place, were to perform a distinct and different service
in war; sometimes in a single night they would march fifty
miles. Sometimes in a day they would march seventy-five to
ninety miles. They would destroy stores of supplies, wreck
railroads, burn water stations, demolish trestles, attack and
burn wagon trains. Their best living was to be obtained by
victory and the popular application to the fortunes of war
the maxim—“That they should take who have the power,
and they should keep who can.”</p>

<p>To fit them for such service, a new system of drill was
instituted; half cavalry and half infantry, fighting on foot, in
open rank; the charge on infantry on horseback was to become<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span>
practically obsolete. They were, if occasion demanded,
to be dismounted, fight in entrenchments alongside infantry,
and charge batteries and abattis, the same as the infantry.
With boundless energy, unlimited enthusiasm and a measureless
love of adventure, the horseman was to meet these new
requirements and frequently do all that infantry could do
and, in addition, do what cavalry had never done before.
In the West, this combined and new call for cavalry obtained
its birth and hold and received its first and most successful
development. It is urged that to General John H. Morgan
and his followers ought to be accredited the application
and successful demonstration of these new methods, which
were to add such immense value to cavalry work. No commander
ever before undertook to commit such tasks to
horsemen. But the Southern soldier, who first developed
all these qualities and performed these varying tasks, was
to open for the Southern cavalry service an unlimited field
for harassing, delaying, starving and even destroying
opposing armies.</p>

<p>The marvelous endurance of the men who followed
Forrest and Stuart and Morgan and Wheeler and Hampton
and Shelby and Green and McCullough and Price has never
been equalled. Storms and floods had no terror for these.
No enemy was safe from their avenging hand and no vigilance
could defy their enterprise. There were no alarms in any
work for these brave and tireless riders. Single riders and
even small troops of cavalry had made marches of a hundred
miles in a day, but it remained for generals like Wheeler and
Morgan and Forrest and Stuart and Hampton and Shelby
and Marmaduke and Green to demonstrate the potency and
tremendous value of cavalry in war, and lengthen the possibility
of a day’s march.</p>

<p>For the first two years of the conflict, the Confederate
cavalry were practically supreme. Their enemies were slow
to absorb these new methods and to apprehend the advantages
of this new system. Stuart’s Chickahominy raid, his
march from Chambersburg; Morgan’s two marches of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</span>
thousand miles each; Forrest’s pursuit of Streight and his
raid into Kentucky and Tennessee, under the most adverse
physical difficulties, in midwinter or early spring, and his
ride into Memphis, read more like fairy stories than the
performance of men composed of flesh and blood. Wheeler’s
raid in Rosecrans’ rear, his expedition into East Tennessee
and the endurance of his men are almost incredible. These
do not read like the performance of real soldiers, but more
like the make-up of a military dreamer. One may call over
the names of the great battles of the war, either east or west
of the Mississippi River, and while the account of these
engagements lose none of their brilliancy in comparison with
those of any war, yet they cannot surpass, nor in some
respects equal, the work performed by the cavalry. Fleetwood
Hill (Brandy Station), Trevilian Station, Hanging Fork,
Chambersburg, Hartsville, Cynthiana, Shiloh, Mt. Sterling,
Bryce’s Cross-roads, Parker’s Cross Roads and Dug Creek
Gap. Marmaduke’s and Shelby’s Missouri raids and the
pursuit of Stoneman, Garrard and McCook, during the Atlanta
siege, are stories of valor, endurance and sacrifice that
lose nothing in comparison with the deeds of any other
organization of the armies of the Confederate States. In
exposure, in daring, in physical privations, in patience, in
cheerfulness under defeat, in willingness to do and dare, the
horsemen of the Confederacy must always command the
admiration of those who study military records.</p>

<p>An unusual proportion of the Confederate cavalry came
from eight states,—Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee,
Texas, Alabama, Mississippi and South Carolina. When
we call the cavalry roll, its names awaken memories of some
of the most heroic deeds known among men. Every Confederate
state furnished a full quota of horsemen, and none
of them failed to make good when the crucial test came.</p>

<p>Alabama sent into this branch of service Generals
William Wirt Allen, James Hogan, Moses W. Hannon, John
Herbert Kelley, Evander M. Law, John T. Morgan and
P. D. Roddy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</span></p>

<p>This one book must, in the very nature of things, be
limited to a few hundred pages.</p>

<p>It does not and cannot undertake to tell all that was
glorious and courageous in the service of the men who led
and composed the Confederate cavalry. There will doubtless
be some who will ask why certain battles and experiences
were omitted. The author may have selected, in some instances,
what would appear to many critics and readers not
the most notable events in the Confederate cavalry work.</p>

<p>He may have inadvertently left out names that ought to
have been mentioned, campaigns that were of vast importance,
and battles that were full of sublime sacrifice and
marked by the <em>superbest</em> skill.</p>

<p>The book is written with the bias of a cavalry man. It
is written by a man who knows, by personal experience only,
some of the things that happened where Forrest, Wheeler
and Morgan fought. He only knew personally three of the
men whose leadership and skill are detailed in the book.
He never saw Stuart but once, and Forrest a few times,
but he loves the fame of all these splendid men and has
endeavored to do each the fullest justice.</p>

<p>There were one hundred and four Confederate generals,
from brigadier up, who at various times led the horsemen
of the South. A volume could be written of the services of
each. A majority of them were equally brave and valiant,
but fate decreed some should pass under the fiercest light,
and win from fame its most generous awards. It may be
that hereafter other volumes will be written to tell, if not who,
what the Confederate horsemen were. One of the chiefest
aims of this volume is to give Confederate cavalry leaders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</span>
and their followers their just place in the history of the great
war. There is neither purpose nor desire to take aught from
any other branch of the service. The Confederate infantry,
artillery and navy have each a distinct place in the struggle
of the South for its national life. Every Confederate loves
every other Confederate and glories in all that he did to
win the immortality of the Confederate armies. The cavalryman
asks that his work may be recognized and that his
proper place shall be assigned him in the phalanxes of the
brave who stood for Southern independence. He covets
none of the fame that justly belongs to his comrades in other
lines. He only seeks that what he did may be honestly told,
and his achievements be truly recorded. He feels that he
did the best that he could and that he is entitled to a complete
narrative of that which he did and endeavored to do
for his country. He does not claim that he was braver or
more patriotic than his comrades who fought in other departments.
He only asks that the world may know the
dangers he had faced, the difficulties he overcame, the sacrifices
he made, the sufferings he endured and the results his
work accomplished. A true account is his only demand, and
all the world will feel that this is his right.</p>

<p>The writer may not always be literally accurate in the
things he undertakes to recount in this book about Southern
cavalry. He may here and there have made slight mistakes
in the description of the marches and battles he has essayed
to describe. Relying upon books and participants, he could
not always get the things just as they occurred. Eye witnesses
often differ in discussing the same occurrence. There
are hundreds of dates and names recorded in these pages.
Error must have crept in, but in the main the history is what
really happened, and these happenings alone will give Confederate
cavalry fame and renown in all ages and amongst all
nations.</p>

<p>They make up a great history of great leaders and valiant
soldiers, and they must surely add something to the store of
human heroism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</span></p>

<p>There is no desire to depreciate what men on the other side
did. In the later years of the war, the Federal cavalry apprehended
the tactics and the methods of Confederate horsemen,
and they became foemen worthy of any steel. The third year
of the struggle, the mounts of the Southern cavalry became
less efficient and the disparity in arms and supplies more
and more depressing amongst the Confederates. The Federal
generals undertook then to cut Confederate lines of communication,
and to destroy their commissary depots and to
disrupt railway transportation. In such work, in 1864 and
1865, they laid heaviest burdens on the Confederate cavalry;
and in many instances the jaded and starving horses, the
illy-fed men, their scanty supply of ammunition put them
at great disadvantage, but they were, in face of all these
difficulties, game, vigilant, aggressive, enterprising and defiant
to the end; and from April, 1864, to April, 1865, there
was nothing more brilliant nor historic than the work of the
Confederate horsemen, performed under the most unfavorable
conditions, to stay the tide of Federal advance and
success and to maintain to the end their nation’s hope and
their nation’s life.</p>

<p>If the sketches these pages contain shall add one leaf
to the Confederate Laurel Wreath, or bring to Confederate
fame fuller recognition, the author will be many times repaid
for the labor, expense and time expended in their preparation.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">The spring and summer of 1864 in Virginia,
Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia and in the Trans-Mississippi
Department proved one of the most
sanguinary periods of the war.</p>

<p>During this time, Joseph E. Johnston made his
superb retreat from Dalton to Atlanta, regarded by
military historians as one of the ablest strategic movements
of the campaigns from ’61 to ’65, and General
Robert E. Lee, in his famous defensive campaign
culminating in the decimation of Grant’s armies at
Cold Harbor, had killed or wounded more than eighty
thousand of General Grant’s followers, twenty thousand
more effective men than Lee’s whole army numbered!</p>

<p>In the Trans-Mississippi, between April and August,
’64, General Dick Taylor at Mansfield and Pleasant
Hill gained glorious victories in attempting to stay the
advance of General Banks into the heart of Louisiana;
and Kirby Smith, Price, Shelby and Marmaduke in
Arkansas still maintained a courageous front to the foe.
After three years of constant fighting, their soldiers
were more thoroughly inured to the hardships of war,
better trained to face its dangers, and men on both
sides exhibited a recklessness in facing death which
marked the highest tide of courage.</p>

<p>Early in the war the cavalry became one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
most effective arms of the agencies of the Confederates.
With the vast territory in the West defended by the
Confederacy, with a frontier line twenty-five hundred
miles in extent, the marching speed of which mounted
men are capable, the cavalry of the South, at this
period, enabled them to do more, man for man, than
any arm of the South’s defenders. They proved not
only the best allies of the Confederate cause, but later
developed some of the most renowned cavalry leaders
of the world.</p>

<p>There were many cavalry battles during the fifteen
hundred and twenty days of the war—Trevilian Station,
Fleetwood Hill, sometimes called “Brandy Station,”
Harrisburg, Hartsville, Okolona, Murfreesboro,
Shiloh, Parkers Cross Roads, Reams Station, all of
which gave resplendence to the fame of the Confederate
horsemen. Over and above these cavalry battles,
there was Bryce’s Cross Roads, designated by the
Federals as the Battle of Tishomingo Creek. Measured
by losses, it stands pre-eminent; along strategic lines
it is amongst the first, and counted by results to the
defeated foe, it has no counterpart in any engagement
fought entirely on one side by cavalry.</p>

<p>On the Federal side, two thousand officers and men,
including the wounded, were made prisoners, and more
than twelve hundred dead were left on the battlefield
or in close proximity thereto, if Forrest’s contemporary
reports be correct. The Confederates lost a hundred
and forty killed and three hundred wounded. General
Forrest held the battlefield. His forces buried the dead,
and his count was based upon the fullest knowledge of
the tremendous mortality of this sanguinary engagement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
There were differing statements concerning the
casualties. The numbers here given are from men who
saw the havoc on the field.</p>

<p>At Fleetwood Hill, the Confederates lost five
hundred and twenty-three killed and wounded, and the
Federals nine hundred and thirty-six killed and
wounded. At Trevilian Station, a purely cavalry
engagement, June 11th, 1864, Hampton carried into
battle four thousand seven hundred men against nine
thousand Federals. After the battle and in ten days’
subsequent fighting, his losses in killed, wounded and
prisoners were less than seven hundred. He captured
six hundred and ninety-five Federals, including one
hundred and twenty-five wounded. Hampton’s killed
numbered less than seventy-five. In the Trevilian
campaign, continuing fifteen days, Hampton’s losses
did not exceed seven hundred and fifty killed, wounded
and missing, while the Federals report a loss of one
thousand five hundred and twelve, more than twice
that of the Confederates. At Hartsville, the Confederates
lost a hundred and twenty-five killed and wounded,
and the Federals four hundred and thirty, with eighteen
hundred captured. At Harrisburg, Mississippi, one
thousand two hundred and eighty-seven Confederates
were killed and wounded. At Bull Run the Federals
lost in killed and wounded one thousand four hundred
and ninety-two, with one thousand four hundred and
sixty missing. The Confederates lost one thousand
eight hundred and seven. On both sides approximately
fifty-six thousand men were engaged. At Shiloh,
April 6th and 7th, 1862, the Federal death roll was
seventeen hundred and that of the Confederates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
seventeen hundred and twenty-eight, and yet on both
sides ninety thousand men were engaged in the struggle.
At Wilson’s Creek, the Federal loss was one thousand
three hundred and seventeen, the Confederate loss
one thousand two hundred and eighteen. There the
forces were nearly evenly matched, and there were about
ten thousand in the struggle. Accepting General
Forrest’s report to be true that more than twelve hundred
men were killed and wounded in the six hours of
fighting at Bryce’s Cross Roads, then more men were
killed and captured on that day than in any two other
purely cavalry engagements of the war.</p>

<p>By June, 1864, Forrest had reached the full tide of
his fame. He had improved every opportunity to
develop his genius, and he never failed to make use of
all the fighting opportunities that came his way. He
did not always get the best the quartermaster had, and
he had been hampered by interference from headquarters.
He had long since ceased to rely upon his government
for his mounts, clothing, arms and food. He had
months before learned from actual experience that the
Federals had better supplies than it was possible for
the Confederacy to distribute, and that capture from
his enemies was a quicker and surer way of getting what
he wanted than to risk the red tape and poverty of
Confederate quartermaster regulations.</p>

<p>Beginning as a private, Forrest had reached most
distinguished rank. Both friends and enemies awarded
him a high place among the great commanders of the
war, whether in infantry or cavalry. Fort Donelson,
Shiloh, Nashville, Murfreesboro, his raid into West
Tennessee, his capture of Streight, and conflicts at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
Brentwood, Harper’s Bridge, Chickamauga, his raid
into middle Tennessee, West Point, Mississippi and
the capture of Fort Pillow, had woven about him and
his work a crown of romance and glory, and had justly,
on his absolute merits, made him one of the most renowned
leaders of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>His enemies feared and hated him as they did no
other general of the South. War with Forrest was not
only “hell,” but savagest hell. His idea of war was to
fight and kill and destroy with fiercest energy. It has
been said that he considered the raising of the black
flag as the most economical and merciful way of ending
the war. His methods were not calculated to impress
his foes with admiration. The many reverses they had
suffered at his hands, the wholesome fear of his presence,
his desperate courage, boundless resources,
rapidity of movement, rapidity of onslaught, recklessness
in facing death, and insensibility to fatigue made
failure practically unknown in his campaigns, and he
became a terror to his foes and a tower of strength to
his comrades.</p>

<p>There was no Federal commander that did not
count Forrest as a power to be considered, or a potent
factor against which it was wise to calculate. General
Grant and other Federal commanders did not hesitate
to declare that Forrest had the Federal forces in
Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi hacked. They
called him “scoundrel” and “devil,” and put a price
on his head, but this did not drive fear out of their
hearts, or prevent some degree of tremor when they
knew of his presence in the places where they were
going, or where they thought he might happen to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>Prior to and shortly after the battle of Bryce’s
Cross Roads, all the Federal generals were devising
ways and means for the destruction of Forrest. On
June 24th, 1864, General Sherman sent President
Lincoln the following despatch:</p>

<p>“I have ordered General A. J. Smith and General
Mower to pursue and kill Forrest, promising the latter,
in case of success, my influence to promote him to
Major General. He is one of the gamest men in our
service. Should accident befall me, I ask you to favor
him, if he succeeds in killing Forrest.” Signed, William
T. Sherman, Major General.</p>

<p>This was the highest price put on any Confederate
officer’s life during the war, and there is no other instance
in American military history where one general
found it necessary, in order to destroy an opposing
major general, to offer a premium for his life and to
openly declare that his death was the highest aim to be
sought.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the offer was not for dispersing
Forrest’s forces; it was not for his capture;
but “to pursue and kill.” General Sherman did not
want Forrest alive, else he would have framed his murderous
suggestion in a different form. The idea of a
possible surrender was ignored. Sherman seems to
have proceeded upon the idea that dead men cease
to fight or destroy communications. He told Mower
to take no chances, but to “kill.” This is the only
instance among the Confederate or Federal commanders
where a superior incited a subordinate to murder. He
said once before in speaking of Forrest, “That devil
Forrest must be eliminated, if it costs ten thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
lives and breaks the treasury.” See despatch. Twice,
in his telegram to President Lincoln, he lays stress upon
the word “kill.” First he says, “if he pursues and kills
I promised him a major generalship;” second, “if he
succeeds in killing Forrest, and aught happens to me
so that I cannot make good, I ask you to favor him and
give him the promotion which is the price of Forrest’s
death.”</p>

<p>How transcendent Forrest’s success must have
been in his operations along the Federal lines to have
produced this degree of fear in General Sherman’s
mind! Sherman was a brave and skillful general, but
he seemed to consider that General Forrest’s ability
to injure the Federal armies was greater than that of
any other living man, and with malignant hate, extreme
fear, and almost barbarous cruelty, he offered a major
generalship to an ambitious young brigadier general,
if he would pursue and kill the Confederate leader.
War amongst civilized nations is carried on against
commands or organized bodies, not individuals. General
Sherman reversed this well-recognized principle
and declared war on an individual and offered a price
for his destruction. He asserted that he had better
sacrifice ten thousand of his countrymen and expend
all its treasury contained than to let one man live to
fight. The pressing exigencies invoked by Forrest’s
campaigns silenced the traditions and usages of war,
and made his destruction, in Sherman’s mind, justifiable
by any means, foul or fair, and at any cost, however
extravagant or hurtful, to rid his department of a
brave and aggressive foe.</p>

<p>This proposition to reward General Mower was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
to General Sherman’s credit. He declared “war was
hell,” but at no period of the war’s history and by no
other Federal general was the death of any one man
made a patriotic duty, or recommended and encouraged
in the service of the Federal army. The South
never had any reason to love General Sherman. He
and Sheridan never respected as did other Union generals
the rights of non-combatants. His subsequent
burning of Columbia created in Southern breasts the
harshest memories, but the incitement to killing Forrest,
as the surest means of promotion and success for
his subordinate added much to the grounds of the
South for the bitterest hate. With half a century to
calm passion, to still prejudice and restore reason, it is
difficult to realize what a frenzy of fear and hate Forrest
had aroused in the hearts of his enemies.</p>

<p>After failures, not necessary to recount, one last
effort was made to run Forrest down and to annihilate
or cripple his command. Forrest had been transferred
to the Mississippi and West Tennessee Department.
It was known as Forrest’s Department. General
C. C. Washburn, in command at Memphis, was ordered
to send six thousand men in a final effort to rout
General Forrest. Instead, he says he sent eight thousand,
but he really sent ten thousand five hundred.
Colonel George E. Waring, who commanded one of the
Federal brigades, says, “We were a force of nine thousand
infantry and artillery sent as a tub to the Forrest
Whale.” Captain Tyler, who operated in Sturgis’ rear,
captured the returns made out for the day. These
showed ten thousand five hundred present for duty.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>
<p>Other Federal generals had been tried out and
found wanting, and in this last effort General Sherman
called an experienced soldier, General Samuel Davis
Sturgis, who had won great reputation in other departments.
He had seen service under Lyon in Missouri,
and after the death of that general, succeeded to command
at the Battle of Wilson’s Creek. Assigned to the
Army of the Tennessee, later he was ordered to the
command of the Department of Kansas. In 1862 he
was summoned to Washington and given charge of the
defense around the city, and he commanded a part of
the 9th Army Corps at the Battles of South Mountain,
Antietam and Fredericksburg. For nearly a year he
was chief of the cavalry in the Department of Ohio,
and there he did most effective work for his country’s
cause. He was counted as “dead game,” a man of great
force and energy and of extended experience. He was
born in Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, on the 11th of
June, 1822, and was forty-two years old at the time of
the Battle of Bryce’s Cross Roads. With him was
assigned General B. H. Grierson, who was just thirty-seven
years of age. As early as 1862 he had been placed
in the command of a cavalry brigade, and had been
conspicuous in skirmishes and raids in North Mississippi
and West Tennessee. Under General Grant’s eye he
had made what was considered a particularly fortunate
raid from La Grange to Baton Rouge. In June, ’63, he
was brevetted a brigadier general of Volunteers, and
was regarded as a most stubborn fighter.</p>

<p>To these brigadier generals was added Colonel
George E. Waring. At twenty-eight he became major
of the 39th New York Volunteers. In August he was
sent West as a major of cavalry, and shortly afterwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
he became colonel of the 4th Missouri Cavalry. In
1863 he was in command of the cavalry brigade in
South Missouri and North Arkansas. In 1863 he had
command of sixty-five hundred men, mainly cavalry.
He had gone with Smith and Grierson, and was now
to go with Sturgis. His experience was wide and his
courage of the very highest order. He was a gallant,
good-natured and fierce fighter, and was not ashamed
to admit the truth when he was fairly defeated. It
was said by General Forrest of Colonel Waring, that
his cavalry charge at Okolona, Mississippi, some time
previous to this date, was the most brilliant cavalry
exploit he had ever witnessed.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate for the Confederates that
General S. A. Hurlburt was not added to this trio. In
one of his reports, found in the Official Reports, Volume
31, Part 1, Page 697, after failing to capture General
Forrest, he said, “I regret very much that I could not
have the pleasure of bringing you his hair, but he is too
great a coward to fight anything like an equal force,
and we will have to be satisfied with driving him from
the State.” General Hurlburt studied the results of
Bryce’s Cross Roads and learned that, after all the
abuse heaped upon him by his enemies, Forrest occasionally
enjoyed a fight even though he was compelled
to try out conclusions with his foes with an odds
against him of more than two to one.</p>

<p>This boastful soldier, more bloodthirsty even than
his associates, not only proposed to kill Forrest, but
after death to scalp his fallen foe and lay at the feet
of his superior a savage trophy like the Indians of old,
in the pioneer days of Kentucky and Tennessee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>In addition to this array of distinguished and experienced
officers, the most careful provision was made
in arming of the troops that were to undertake the
expedition. They were given Colt’s five-chambered,
repeating rifles or breech-loading carbines, and were
also supplied with six-shooters.</p>

<p>Two cavalry brigades and three brigades of infantry
made up the force which was deemed capable of coping
with Forrest under all conditions. Curiously enough,
there was added a brigade of colored infantry. The
events at Fort Pillow, on the 12th day of April, 1864,
sixty days before, had been used to arouse the animosity
and fiercest hate of the colored troops. It was claimed
that General Forrest had refused to allow the colored
forces quarter and had shot them down after they had
surrendered. While this was amply disproved by overwhelming
testimony, it served a good purpose to make
the colored troops desperate in any fighting which
should fall to their lot, and to make them unwilling to
surrender to Forrest’s men under any possible circumstances.</p>

<p>Correspondence between General Washburn and
General Forrest brought out mention of no quarter,
and it was claimed that General Washburn, in dispatching
these troops, had suggested to this colored
contingent to refuse quarter to Forrest’s command. If
not actually advising, he certainly acquiesced in their
wearing some badges pinned upon their lapels, upon
which had been printed these fateful words: “No
quarter to Forrest’s men.” To a man of Forrest’s successes
and with his wonderful record in the capture of
Federal prisoners, this was a most unfortunate declaration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
for those who were to pursue him, considering the
uncertainty that attended those who might engage him
in battle.</p>

<p>The object of this expedition was to drive Forrest
from Western Tennessee and fully restore communication
from Memphis down the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>The Federal commander did not take into account
the heat of a Mississippi summer nor the torrential
rains that so frequently inundate that portion of the
South in June and July. On the day of the battle, the
thermometer rose to one hundred and seven degrees;
not a ripple stirred the air; the leaves were as still as
death itself; men panted for breath.</p>

<p>The thicket was so dense that no eye could penetrate
its recesses for twenty feet, and vision was so circumscribed
that foes were almost invisible. In its impenetrable
and pathless precincts, black jack and small oak
trees had grown up into a jungle, and the men entering
this gloomy and perplexing battlefield were unable to
even conjecture what a minute would bring forth.
Every nerve was strained; every muscle tense. No one
cared for a second to avert his gaze from the front. At
any instant a foe might spring up and fire in the face of
the man who was advancing. A single step might reveal
a line of battle, and the flash of gun or crack of a
rifle was momentarily expected. A movement of the
branches and rustling of the leaves might draw fatal
volleys from carbines, rifles or revolvers, and here and
there the crash of shells and the roar of cannon added
to the fearfulness of the situation. The dangers and
dread of every step were accentuated by the harassing
uncertainty of the surroundings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>The western Confederate cavalry at short range
always found the revolver the most effective weapon.
Enfield rifles were good enough up to three hundred
feet, but closer than that Forrest’s and Morgan’s and
Wheeler’s men relied upon their six-shooters. The men
under Stuart and Hampton loved “the white arm,” the
knightly sabre; they found that it helped at Fleetwood
Hill and Trevilian Station. Mosby’s greatest reliance
was on “Colt’s Navies,” and there were but few swords
ever found with the cavalry of the Army of Tennessee.
To the western Confederate horsemen, their heavy
revolver was a great equalizer. The Federal soldier,
when it came to short range, had no better weapon.
At close quarters, with a firm grip on a six-shooter, a
Confederate soldier felt he was the equal of any foe
from any place, and thus armed when it came where he
could see the color of the other soldier’s eyes, he considered
the Navy revolver the choicest weapon man
could make. It was a destructive weapon in the hands
of brave, calm soldiers. The bayonet lost all terrors
to those who possessed this effective pistol. No advancing
antagonist could hope to safely reach a man of
nerve with a pistol, amidst this black jack and heavy
foliage. There, ears sharpened by battle’s dangers,
and eyes made brighter by hidden foes, gave great
zest to the game of war.</p>

<p>Leaving Memphis on the 1st of June, the approach
of Sturgis and his command was slow and careful, surrounded
with every possible precaution against surprise.
The leaders knew the character of the enemy they must
face, and they resolved to leave nothing undone which
should prepare them for his furious onslaughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>Bryce’s Cross Roads, or Guntown, was seventy-six
miles from Memphis. Nine days were consumed in the
march. On the night of the 9th, Sturgis and his forces
encamped on the Stubbs farm, about six miles from
Bryce’s Cross Roads. At this point was a blacksmith’s
shop and a store, and two roads crossed each
other, one running southeast and the other almost
directly south. A mile and a half away was Tishomingo
Creek, a slimy and almost currentless stream
at this period, although it had been replenished by the
rains two days before. The soil of the road was the
friable bottom land of Mississippi, which churns quickly
into slush and then soon dries out.</p>

<p>About the time that Sturgis left Memphis, Forrest
had started on a raid in middle Tennessee to break up
the railroad connection south of Nashville. At the
same time General Sherman was trying to fight
his way to Atlanta, and it was deemed important
to destroy the railroads between Chattanooga and
Nashville.</p>

<p>Forrest had only gone a short distance when he was
notified by General Stephen D. Lee to give up his raid
and return to face Sturgis and his command, which had
left Memphis a few days before.</p>

<p>There has been a good deal of discussion as to
whether General Lee was willing for Forrest to fight at
Bryce’s Cross Roads. Certainly General Lee hoped
that Sturgis would be permitted to march farther down
into Mississippi before the contact should be forced.
It seems, however, from what General Forrest told
General Buford that he had made up his mind to bring
on the engagement just where it occurred. And yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
his troops were not in position to justify his engaging in
a great battle.</p>

<p>Lyon, with his eight hundred men from Kentucky,
Johnson, with a small brigade of Alabamians, were six
miles away from the scene of battle at Baldwin; the
artillery was at Booneville, eighteen miles away. It
rained heavily on the 8th and 9th. General Forrest
had said to General Buford, “They outnumber me, but
I can whip them; the cavalry will be in advance, and
we can defeat the cavalry before the infantry can march
to their relief. It is going to be as hot as hell. The infantry
will come on the run into the battle, and with
the muddy roads and hot weather, they will be tired
out, then we can ride over them. I will go ahead with
Lyon and my escort and open up the fight.” The wily
Confederate general knew that soldiers never do their
best when they enter battle after great physical
punishment.</p>

<p>Sturgis knew that Forrest was around, and he felt
sure that if he did not find Forrest, Forrest would find
him. The night before the battle, Sturgis had intuition
of disaster. Caution warned him to go back, and the
temptation was very strong, but he had promised
General Washburn and General Sherman much before
he had started. He had boasted what he could do, or
would do, and the instinct of courage prevailed over
his instinct of fear and bade him go on.</p>

<p>At break of day Forrest’s forces were all moving.
They were converging to Bryce’s Cross Roads. Grierson,
in command of the Federal column, had left Stubb’s
farm to march toward Bryce’s Cross Roads. The
Federal infantry cooked their breakfast in a leisurely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
way, and were not ready to march until seven-thirty.
Experienced and faithful scouts were bringing to Lyon,
who was in the Confederate front, the accurate information
of the movements of General Waring, who led
the Federal advance with his brigade.</p>

<p>On the road, a mile and a half away from Tishomingo
Creek, General Lyon had placed a strong picket.
Two videttes were at the bridge that spanned Tishomingo
Creek. These were not particular upon the order
of their going. They fled southward, pursued by Waring’s
advance guard, which was followed by his entire
command, and also by the other brigade of Federal
cavalry. Lyon needed no commander to tell him what
to do. To him belongs the credit of having opened the
greatest of all cavalry battles, and to have done more
than any one Confederate officer, other than Forrest,
to win the crushing defeat of the Union forces on that
historic field.</p>

<p>Forrest, with his men all counted, had only forty-seven
hundred cavalry. This was the most he could
rely on when more than half of them should gallop
eighteen miles. Deducting horseholders, one in four,
and the men who could not keep up in the mad pace
necessary to get into position, Forrest could not have
more than thirty-two hundred fighters in any period
of the battle. Against these were Sturgis’ cavalry
and infantry and twenty-six pieces of artillery—all
told, over ten thousand effectives. At the opening of
the engagement, Forrest had eight hundred men
with Lyon, eighty-five men as escort, and fifty men
in Gartrell’s company, making a total of nine hundred
and thirty-five.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>Forrest resolved to have what he called “a bulge”
on the enemy. In his plain, untutored way he had said
“bulging would beat tactics.” Forrest had with him
leaders who knew their business, and who understood
his methods. They had been apt scholars in his school
of war, and they were now going to put their teaching
into practical effect, and under his eye and leadership
win applause and glory for centuries to come.</p>

<p>One of Forrest’s favorite maxims was, “Keep your
men a-going.” With a fierce feint, he undertook to
deceive General Grierson, the Federal cavalry leader,
as to his real strength. He had two-thirds less men than
Grierson, and he was afraid that Grierson would attack
him and rush his line, which he could have done, and
scattered his forces.</p>

<p>With his limited numbers, he made the greatest
possible show. Lyon had entrenched his men behind
brush heaps, rail fences and logs. This was very warm,
but it was much safer than out in the open. Finally
Forrest ordered his soldiers to cross the open ground,
and doubling his skirmish line, boldly marched out.
They were widely overlapped by Waring and Winslow
with their brigades, and for an hour Lyon bravely and
fiercely kept up his feint, and then retired behind his
entrenchments. A great burden was on Lyon’s mind,
but when it was most oppressive, the glad sound of
the rebel yell fell upon his ears and then appeared
horses flecked with foam, with their mouths open,
breathing with stentorious sounds, panting as if ready
to fall. Rucker and his tired troops, after a ride of
fourteen miles, were on the ground, and quickly dismounting
they went into line. Haste was the order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
of the hour. Lyon, to be saved, must be strengthened.
Alone he had faced the thirty-two hundred Federal
cavalry, and while he maintained his ground, no idea
of running away had ever come into his mind. Three
and one-half to one man had no terrors for Forrest with
these Kentucky men. They were mostly mounted
infantry, who had often heard the storm of battle.</p>

<p>Forrest patted Lyon on the back, and commended
him for the splendid stand which he had made. Rucker,
brave, gallant, chivalrous, had heard the roar of cannon,
and although his tired horses were supposed to have
reached their limit, he pleaded with his men to force
them to still greater effort. He could hear through the
cannon’s roars the voices of comrades calling. He knew
they were outnumbered nearly four to one and were
being hardly pressed, and that he was their only hope
of rescue.</p>

<p>The scene changes! They are now only two to one,
and Forrest again advances and presses his lines close
up to the Federal position. Before, he was afraid his
enemies might realize his inferior numbers and rush
him; now, with Johnson and Rucker, he had one to
two. Before, nine hundred men had constituted his
fighting force; now, sixteen hundred were hurried to
the front. The lines of anxiety disappeared from Forrest’s
face; he never doubted when he could count one
to two. At eleven, the fighting had been going on an
hour and a quarter. Time was precious. The Federal
infantry, struggling through the heavy mire and panting
under that awful heat, were pressing on as fast as
human strength and endurance would permit. General
Bell was not yet in reach; he had to ride twenty-one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
miles to get on the ground and join in the fray. If
Waring and Winslow could be swept out of the way,
Forrest felt sure he could take care of the infantry when
Bell came. Prudence might have dictated delay until
Bell was on the scene, but the exigencies of the moment
called for instant and decisive action. Morton, with
his invincible artillery, was slashing his horses and with
almost superhuman energy was urging his beasts to the
highest tension to join in saving the day, but the longing
eyes of Forrest, Lyon, Johnson and Rucker could not
detect his coming, and no sign of Bell’s shouting riders
came through the murky air to tell them that succor
was nigh at hand.</p>

<p>The time for feinting was past. Forrest understood
that the crisis was upon him, and he always grasped the
crucial moment. Riding swiftly in front of his forces
through the jungles, he told his men that the time had
come to win, that when the bugle sounded every man
must leave cover, cross the open space, where it was
open, and charge through the thickets where they prevailed,
and rush their enemies. He rode like a centaur,
giving his orders along the line. The comforting,
encouraging word, the hardly pressed soldiers speaking
bravely together, was ended now. Action, sharp and
decisive, was the watchword. The clear, sharp tones
of the bugle cut the murky air; the sound waves drove
its inspiring notes across the battle front and, like a
crouching beast springing upon its prey, every Confederate
bounded forward. The sharp rebel yell filled
the surrounding space and fell ominously upon the expectant
ears of their foes.</p>

<p>The men of Waring and Winston braced themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
for the coming assault. Their fire was reserved to the
last moment, and then the repeating rifles with their
unbroken volleys, increasing in volume every moment,
created a din that was appalling. The Confederates
had only one fire, and that they reserved to the end.
Their enthusiasm was at fever heat, and rushing on to
close with their foes, fear was cast aside. The enemy
was in front; tiger-like, the men in gray sprang forward.
The keen, sharp whistle of the carbine balls and the buzz
of the bullets filled the air in their passage, and cut the
leaves and branches from the trees so that they fell like
showers of dew upon the rushing Confederates. The
Federals hurled their deep-toned battle-cry across the
narrow space. They had come so close that they could
now see face to face, and each line shouted defiance at
the other. The blue and gray rushed upon each other
with the ferocity of uncaged lions. The single shots
from the Confederate Enfields, so long held, were now
by pre-arranged command fired, and then the Confederates
were ordered to draw their six-shooters and
rush upon their foes. And quick as thought, the sharper
sound of the six-shooters filled the air.</p>

<p>The Confederates had momentarily recoiled before
the first terrific fire so unexpectedly poured into their
ranks, but the Federals, in the face of the six-shooters,
began to waver. One or the other must yield. The
Confederates were pushing the conflict. Waring ordered
up two new regiments to halt the advancing tide.
The contest was short, but it was vehement. At close
range, nothing could equal the six-shooter. The sword
and carbine could not stay its murderous effect in the
hands of the brave and determined Confederates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>Hand to hand, the conflict went on, but flesh and
blood could not withstand such an assault. The Federal
line began to yield. Lyon, Rucker, Johnson and Forrest
urged their brave men to supreme effort. The tide was
still for an instant, but only an instant. The reinforcements
of Waring were brushed away, his lines broken.
The apparent yielding of the Union cavalry encouraged
and emboldened the men of the South, and now they
drove forward with increasing energy and ferocity to
the death grapple. Ammunition failing, the men used
the empty rifles and carbines as clubs. A hand to hand
fight cannot last long. Decimation of numbers soon
weakens its intensity, but the proximity of men, looking
each other in the eye, shouting defiance into the very
faces of their foes, proves a tremendous strain upon any
soldiers, and such fearful tension weakens enthusiasm
and one side or the other begins to consider yielding.
Rucker, Lyon, Hall and Johnson of Alabama were
terrific fighters; they had caught Forrest’s spirit and
they advanced with such vehemence that it was almost
impossible for any line to withstand them. The moment
Waring’s men began to give way, victory deserted the
Federal standards. The piercing of the Union lines,
the loss of its initial position, gave the Confederates
added impetuosity and intensity in their advance.
Nature was adding renewed difficulties to the conflict.
The fierce summer sun was almost scalding. Perspiration
burst from every pore. Men, under the intense
heat, panted for breath. Forrest’s men knew they
must win at once or fail in the struggle. Not waiting
even to be called, they pressed forward over the bodies
of their fallen comrades and enemies. The Southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
troopers seemed imbued with an insatiate thirst for
the blood of their opponents. They remembered what
Forrest had told them to do when the bugle blast
brought them out from cover, and bade them press the
fighting, and drive the Federals back. Thus, impelled
by the necessity of immediate victory, answering the
summons of their well-beloved commander, and thrilled
by the memory of their past glorious achievements,
they became almost a line of demons. They cared
nothing for wounds or death; they were bent only on
the defeat and destruction of their foes, and for the
accomplishment of this were ready to win or fall, as
fate should cast the die.</p>

<p>Forrest, within fifteen minutes of the time when the
first shot was fired, had sent one of his most trusted
staff officers to meet General Tyree H. Bell and bid him
“move up fast and fetch all he’s got,” and to this he
added a word to his beloved boy artillery man, Captain
Morton, to stay not his coming but to bring up his
horses at a gallop. Forrest’s keen eye was watching
with deepest anxiety to catch some sight of the coming
ones, his ears attuned to catch the echo of the cheers
of Bell’s men or the rushing tramp of the tired steeds;
but nothing was heard of his allies, needed so badly at
this crucial moment.</p>

<p>He knew that Sturgis with his infantry would soon
be on the ground, and that his tired and powder-grimed
men could not withstand this new ordeal, when four
thousand fresh infantry would change the alignments
and render resistance of their impact impossible. A
thousand conflicting emotions filled Forrest’s heart,
but Forrest was not to be stayed. “Forward, forward!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
he cried to his men. Slowly, then quickly, the Federal
cavalry yielded, and then Forrest pressed them back in
disorder.</p>

<p>The spirit of resistance was broken. Waring and
Winston could not, with all their courage and skill,
stay the work of Forrest’s battalions. They rushed
from the front, giving to the men in gray complete
possession of the coveted battlefield.</p>

<p>General Sturgis, in advance of his panting infantry,
had arrived at the scene of the struggle. Message after
message of emergency had come to him by swift-riding
couriers. His infantry were forced all that nature
would allow. These Federal soldiers were weighted
down with their accoutrements, and suffering the almost
resistless heat of the burning rays of a fierce
summer sun and an atmosphere so sultry and humid
that human lungs inhaling it were weakened rather
than refreshed.</p>

<p>The Federal cavalry were glad to ride away, and,
hurrying from such scenes of carnage and woe, disorganized
and beaten, they tried to reform behind the
upcoming infantry. It was with a profound sense of
relief that they gave over the field to the footmen and
let them face, in the bushes and jungle, the Confederate
cavalrymen, who with such devilish fury had worsted
them in the fighting of the past three hours and thinned
their ranks by killing and wounding a large percentage
of their number.</p>

<p>The Federal cavalry, in this brief struggle, had
pushed their magazine guns and carbines to the highest
pressure. Their ammunition was gone, and without
bayonets they could not halt the Confederate assailants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
who behind their six-shooters let no obstacle,
even for an instant, stay their progress.</p>

<p>Forrest’s prediction that he would whip the Federal
cavalry before the infantry could get up was verified,
but unless Bell with his reserves and Morton with his
artillery were quickly at hand, his success would avail
nothing.</p>

<p>The Federal infantry was quickly put in line, and
even Forrest felt for an instant a sense of doubt, as he
surveyed his tired followers, and scanned their faces,
worn and sharply drawn by the harrowing experiences
of the past three hours.</p>

<p>However resourceful, he could not immediately
reach a conclusion as to what was best. His soul abhorred
yielding now that he had won glorious victory,
and the thought of abandoning it all at last and leaving
his dead and wounded followers on the field and the
triumph of his hated foes, filled his soul with keenest
anguish. For himself, he would rather die a thousand
deaths than to do this hateful thing. At his command,
by superhuman courage, his boys (as he called them)
had discomfited and driven away their foe, and as he
looked down into the pale faces of the dead, who lay
amidst the bushes and debris of the torrid forest, as
he heard the groans of his gallant wounded and
dying, burning with thirst and fever, as they pleaded
for water, he dared not forsake them. The whistle
of the rifle balls, the screech of the shrapnel again
beginning to play upon his position urged him to
speediest decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>
<p>At this critical moment, while the firing on his side
was spasmodic and occasional, he heard cheers and
shouts. A moment later, from the woody recesses of
the thicket, he caught sight of the face of Tyree H.
Bell. The message he had sent two hours before had
been heard. Bell had “moved fast and fetched all he’s
got” and Morton had “brought on his artillery at a
gallop.” True, many of the artillery horses had
dropped dead by the wayside, overcome by the terrific
punishment they had received in hastening to the scene
of action, but as the dropping beast breathed his last,
the harness was snatched from his dead body and flung
upon another beast who had galloped or trotted behind
the guns. These brutes had seen their fellows belabored
with whips to increase their speed to the utmost,
and if they reasoned at all they reluctantly assumed the
burdens of their dead brothers and regretfully and sullenly
took their places in front of the guns, made so
heavy and so oppressive by the heat and by mud of the
slushy roads.</p>

<p>When the supply of horses, in this mad rush of
nineteen miles, gave out, cavalry men were dismounted
and despite their protest, their horses were harnessed
to the guns and caissons, which now at the highest
possible speed were being dragged and hauled to the
front, where Forrest was holding his foes at bay, or
driving them in confusion from the field.</p>

<p>The first act of the grim drama had come out as
Forrest had expected, and now the second was begun.
He had vanquished the Federal cavalry and now he
must destroy the Federal infantry. Bell had brought
him two thousand men who, although wearied by a
twenty mile ride during the past seven hours, had fired
no guns and faced no foes. He had tried these newcomers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
in the past, and he did not fear to trust them in
this supreme moment.</p>

<p>The Confederate chieftain did not long hesitate.
He knew whatever was done must be done quickly.
The Federal cavalry would soon be reorganized; the
clash with the infantry (if they withstood the onslaught
from the Confederates) would give the defeated horsemen
new courage, and they would come back into the
struggle far fiercer than before, for as brave men they
would long to wipe out the memories and avenge their
humiliating defeat with final victory.</p>

<p>The Federal infantry did not reach the battlefield
until 1 p. m. They came under the most trying circumstances;
the roads and the weather together were
against them. The human body has its limitations.
The Federal infantry did all men could have done; a
majority of them were unaccustomed to the dreadful
heat of the Mississippi thickets and swamps; they had
been forced to the very highest efforts on the way; the
sounds of battle were ringing in the ears of their leaders—the
sultry air did not conduct the sound waves distinctly,
but they heard enough to know that a desperate
struggle was already on, and they were soon to participate
in its dangers and its experiences. Aides came
riding in hot haste from where the noise of strife was
heard; the messages were delivered to the advance
guard, but the hard-riding couriers were hastily escorted
to the Federal leaders, and the solemnity of
their faces and the seriousness of their visage unmistakably
proclaimed that sternest business was being
enacted at the place from which they had in such haste
so furiously ridden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>The Federal cavalry, in squads and disorganized
masses, was retreating from the front. No shout of
victory or cheers had come from the horsemen to urge
the infantry forward to the conflict, which had gone
sorely against those who rode. Here and there an
ambulance bearing wounded officers and privates
told in unmistakable terms what losses were awaiting
those who were pressing toward the conflict, and
bandaged heads and bloody faces, and wounded arms
and legs told the story of carnage where these sufferers
had been.</p>

<p>Regimental and company officers were commanding
more rapid marching. These men in blue had suffered,
on the way, dreadful punishment from the sultry heat,
still they were bidden with loud and vociferous orders
to press forward. They were now beginning to catch
sight of the wreckage, an overturned ambulance, a dead
horse, streams of disabled men, broken wagons, fleeing
teamsters, riding detached animals with the harness
swinging about their legs, all made a depressing scene.</p>

<p>The Federal infantry were of good stuff. When
within half a mile of the Confederate lines, they vigorously
responded to the command “double quick march”
and ran forward to meet a foe of which they could see
but little. The buzz of the rifle balls they heard on
every side, and the defiant yells, which came from the
bushes and recesses of the thickets, into which the men
in blue were being hurried to find somebody to fight,
were no pleasant sounds.</p>

<p>As the Federal infantry swung into line, yells and
cheers from the Confederate forces came across the
short space between them. Something important was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
happening. Some relief and mitigation was at hand.
The shouts were of gladness and not those of grief or
even of battle. The Confederate artillery was swinging
out to the front. The Confederate cavalry always had
good artillerists, Pelham, Chew, Cobb, Rice, Morton,
Thrall and Freeman were men whom any commander
might covet and in whose services they might glory.</p>

<p>Forrest had two wonderful qualities. He made all
his associates recklessly brave. They absorbed the
touch of strange and ever-masterful courage that came
oozing from his every pore. He was, besides, a wonderful
judge of men; all his staff were men not only of
intrepid spirit but of quick intelligence and infinite
patriotism. They knew Forrest’s limitations, but they
understood his marvelous greatness. That Forrest was
sometimes harsh, even cruel and bitter in his judgment
and in his words and acts, none knew better than the
superb men on his staff; but his transcendent genius,
his matchless courage and his immeasurable loyalty
overshadowed his faults, so that the light which came
from his greatness so magnified his presence and power
as to dwarf and blot out that which in many men would
have been hateful deformities.</p>

<p>The battle line was not an extended one. Well for
the Confederates that this was so. With no reserves
and outnumbered two to one, the shorter the range of
action the better, for the smaller force.</p>

<p>Three thousand six hundred fresh infantry were now
thrown into the whirlpool of battle. The Federal
cavalry cowered behind their allies, who had walked and
then ran in that dreadful summer heat to help them in
their extremity. The heavy fire of the infantry, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
constant peal and boom of the artillery notified Forrest
that the best reliance of the Federal general was at hand.
It looked gloomy for the Confederate commander, but
while the character of men and the fire on the Federal
side had changed, General Forrest also had a present
help in this trouble. Brave, gallant Tyree H. Bell
had come. True, his troopers with jaded steeds
had trotted or galloped for nineteen miles under the
blaze of the torrid sun, but the poor beasts who had
carried the men could calmly rest while the fighting part
of the outfit were now ready to take their place in the
freshening fray.</p>

<p>Bell had a noble record. He had been from the first
captain of the 12th Tennessee Infantry. He had acted
as colonel at Belmont, and on the bloody field of
Shiloh again commanded this splendid regiment.
Made its colonel, he had won fresh laurels at Richmond,
Kentucky, in the great victory there under Kirby Smith,
and still later he had become commander of a cavalry
regiment, and at Murfreesboro and Chickamauga had
furiously hammered the Federal flanks. In January,
1864, Forrest, who knew good fighters by instinct, gave
Bell a brigade with five regiments. The most of these
on this glorious day at Bryce’s Cross Roads were to give
another good account of themselves. At Fort Pillow,
Bell with the rifle and revolver had assailed and won a
very strong position, and now again in this conflict, and
in many afterwards, he was to win his great commander’s
admiration and trust.</p>

<p>The pace set by the Federal infantry was fierce, but
Bell’s men made it fiercer. General Buford had come to
join in the battle. Forrest trusted this Kentucky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
general as probably he trusted no other man under him.
With an immense body, weighing three hundred pounds,
he had a sharp, quick, active mind, a fearless soul and
splendid military instincts. A West Point graduate, he
won a brevet at Buena Vista and was in the Santa Fe
expedition in 1848. He gave up a captaincy in the
First United States Dragoons in 1854, and settled on a
splendid blue-grass farm in Woodford County, Kentucky,
the asparagus bed, as Tom Marshall called it,
of the blue-grass. Made a brigadier in 1862, he led
a few hundred Kentucky boys from the State with
Bragg, and with General Joe Wheeler had thoroughly
demonstrated his great ability as a cavalryman.</p>

<p>Those who kept pace with Wheeler and Forrest
must not only be great fighters, but they must be great
cavalrymen. He placed great store by three Kentucky
regiments of infantry, whose longing to ride was at last
gratified by the War Department at Richmond, and on
mules and broken down artillery horses, they had come
to fight with Forrest. These men with Buford had
passed through the roughest military training as infantry,
and when the romance and glamor of cavalry
service came their way, with abounding gratitude for
being allowed to become cavalrymen, they had the
manliness and appreciation to show their government
that they fully deserved the great favor that had been
bestowed upon them.</p>

<p>The Federal men were sturdy Westerners. They
were as brave as the bravest. They had trotted three
miles, double-quicked another mile and marched four
miles; and they had borne this severe punishment
without a murmur. They longed for victory. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
defeat Forrest would give them the approval of their
government and the applause of their comrades; and
they were very anxious to crown the conflict with one
crushing blow at the hated Confederate chieftain who,
with his followers, had not only evaded the Federal
forces sent for his capture, but very often had dashed
their hopes of victory and driven them discomfited
from many fields of strife. These men in blue trusted
that fate would now deliver him into their hands, and
though they feared, they hoped, and this gave firmer
tone to their onslaught.</p>

<p>There was no cleared space for maneuvering. Men
who fought in this battle must go into thickets and
through underbrush to find the foe they sought.</p>

<p>Forrest was too wary a general to allow the Federals
to rest sufficiently long to recover from the depressing
effects of their heated and wearying march. He well
knew that in immediate and decisive attack lay his
only hope of defeating his assailants, who so greatly
outnumbered him. He had genius for finding the places
where the fiercest fray would take place. Grierson’s
cavalry had, like worsted gladiators, sought refuge
behind the men whom they jocularly called “webfeet.”
They had borne the brunt of the battle from ten to two,
had been worsted, and were glad enough to let the walking
men test the mettle of the foes they had failed to
defeat.</p>

<p>Lyon, Johnson and Rucker had fought with the men
under them, with vigor, against Waring and Winston,
and they had longed for a breathing spell, but as Bell’s
brigade, after their twenty-one mile ride, swung into
line, tired though they were, they were yet indisposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
to unload on the newcomers, and so gathering themselves
together, they resolved not to be outdone by
their comrades who had on that dreadful morning not
felt battle’s grievous touch nor hunted through the
heated thickets for those who sought their undoing.</p>

<p>Buford was ordered to slowly press the Federal
right. Fronting Forrest and Bell the Federals were
massing, and here Forrest realized must come the
“tug of war.”</p>

<p>Cautiously, but quickly, Bell’s men sought the newly
aligned Federal infantry under Colonel Hoge. As
Bell’s men advanced, with acute vision, born of expected
danger, they could not even see the men in blue
as they stood with their guns cocked, waiting for a sight
of those who so fearlessly were seeking them in the
recesses of the jungle. They heard the silent, stealthy
approach of the Confederates. The rustle of the leaves,
the pushing aside of the bushes told them the Southern
soldiers were coming. In an instant, without a single
note of warning, the murderous, blazing fire of a thousand
rifles flashed in their faces. Many brave men fell
before this terrible discharge. The dead sank without
noise to the earth and the unrepressed groans of the
wounded for an instant terrorized the Confederate line.
The instinct of safety, for a brief moment, led them to
recoil from this gate of death, and a portion of Bell’s
brave men gave way. The Federal officers quickly
took advantage of the situation and made a strong and
valiant rush upon the broken line. With a shout of
victory upon their lips, they fixed their bayonets and
rapidly pushed through the thicket to disorganize
those who, under the dreadful shock of an unexpected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
fire, had momentarily yielded to fear. This was Forrest’s
time to act. The expected had come. Tying
his own horse to a tree, he bade his escort do likewise,
and he and Bell, calling upon their men to follow,
revolvers in hand, rushed upon the vanguard of the
Federal line. Quick almost as thought itself, the Tennesseeans
came back to the front. Wisdom, with two
hundred and fifty of Newsom’s regiment, leaped also
to the rescue, and those who for a brief space recoiled
now turned with fury upon the line that had dealt them
so sudden and so grievous a blow. Rucker, hard pressed,
bade his men kneel, draw their trusty revolvers and
stand firm. It was now brave infantry with bayonets
against brave cavalry with revolvers. No charge could
break such a line, and the men of the bayonet drew
back from impact with this wall of revolver fire. Hesitating
for a brief space, they recoiled before the charge
of the gallant Confederates. Hoge’s men crumbled
away in the face of the short range and effective aim
of the Southern cavalry. A fierce dash of Forrest, Bell
and Rucker completed their demoralization, and the
men with the bayonets, vanquished, pulled away from
further conflict with these revolver-firing cavalrymen.</p>

<p>At this moment, war’s sweetest music fell upon the
ears of General Forrest. Away north he heard the sound
of conflict. Miles away from the scene of battle,
Forrest had ordered Barteau’s regiment to proceed west
and strike the rear of the Federal forces. The Federal
commanders deemed it wise to hold the colored brigade
in reserve. They were about the wagon train. Forrest
was again to astonish his enemies by a flank and rear
attack. This was unexpected, but it was none the less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
decisive. No Federal cavalry could be spared to reach
the front. Whipped in the morning, they were not even
now, in the middle of the afternoon, ready for a second
tussle with those who had vanquished them. Barteau
had been well trained by his chieftain, for whom he had
aforetime made daring assault under similar circumstances.
The wagon train guard sought safety in flight,
and the colored troopers began to tear from their breasts
the badges printed with those fateful words, “Remember
Fort Pillow. No quarter to Forrest’s men.” These
boastful exhibits were good enough at Memphis on
June 1st, but they became most unsatisfying declarations
at Bryce’s Cross Roads on June 10th. It made a
great difference where they were shown.</p>

<p>A stampede began among these black-skinned
warriors. Vigorously they pulled the badges from their
stricken breasts and trampled them in the dust, ere
Barteau and his furious horsemen could reach their
broken phalanxes. The Federal front was still stubborn
and sullenly refused to yield further ground. To win
it was necessary that this front be broken. With
startling rapidity, Forrest again mounted his horse,
rode the entire length of his line, declaring that the
enemy was breaking, and that the hour of victory was
at hand. Two hours of carnage and conflict had passed
since Bell came. Finding his boy artillerist, Morton,
he ordered him, at a signal, to hitch his horses to four
guns, double shot the pieces with grape and canister,
rush them down close to the enemy’s line, and deliver
his fire. There were no reserves to protect the artillery,
and Morton and Buford spoke a word of caution as to
this extraordinary movement, but Forrest was firm in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
his resolve to test out the movement, if it cost him one-third
of his artillery.</p>

<p>Tyler, with his two companies of the brave 12th
Kentucky, Forrest’s escort and Gartrell’s company of
Georgians, were to go west and charge around the Federal
right, forcing their way to the Federal rear, on
Tishomingo Creek, and engage with pistols any Federal
force that might resist their progress.</p>

<p>Barteau, further east, was pounding the Federal
rear, while Tyler, Jackson and Gartrell with great
fury were hammering the Federal right. One-sixth of
Forrest’s fighting men were now in the Federal rear.
Morton, doubtful, but brave, drove his four guns into
the very face of the enemy, advancing upon them
amidst a storm of fire. His men, leaving their horses
behind, as a small measure of safety, pushed the guns
along the narrow, muddy road with their hands, firing
as they moved. They seemed the very demons of war,
courting death or capture in this grapple for mastery.
The roar of the guns quickened the hopes of the Confederates,
and all along the entire Confederate line a
furious rush was made upon the Federal position. So
close were the opposing forces to each other that they
exchanged words of challenge, and at every point the
Confederates forced the fighting and doubled up the
Federal advance. The game was too fierce to last long.
The brave and daring men in the rear, with Tyler and
Barteau, were riding with a vengeance in every direction,
and with their revolvers were doing deadly work
upon the fleeing foes. This charge was aimed chiefly at
the colored troops, who, with visions before their eyes
and echoes in their ears of Fort Pillow, were ready to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
flee away, without standing upon the order of their
going.</p>

<p>Of this eventful moment, General Sturgis said, “I
now endeavored to get hold of the colored brigade
which formed the guard of the wagon train. While
traversing the short distance to where the head of the
brigade should be formed, the main line gave away at
various points, order soon gave way to confusion and
confusion to panic. The army drifted toward the rear
and was beyond control. The road became crowded
and jammed with troops; wagons and artillery sank
into the deep mud and became inextricable. No power
could check the panic-stricken mass as it swept towards
the rear. The demoralization was complete.” Even
General Sturgis proposed to take the 19th Pennsylvania
Cavalry as an escort, and through the cross roads
of the country, to seek shelter in Memphis. The bridge
across Tishomingo Creek became blocked by overturned
wagons, the fleeing Federals found climbing over
the wagons too slow, and waded or swam the Creek.
Impeded in their flight, great numbers were shot down
as they attempted to pass the stream. Morton’s
artillery rushed to the bank, and hundreds of the Federals,
still exposed to fire, were cut down at this point.
Forrest was as relentless in pursuit as he had been
furious in battle.</p>

<p>As the closing scenes of the battle were concluded,
the sunset came on. Now was the hour of the greatest
triumph. The foe was fleeing, and the horse-holders,
mounted upon the rested beasts, were rushed forward
to gather up the fruits of the splendid victory. There
was to be no let up even in the coming darkness, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
the Confederates who were able, cheerfully hurried to
the front. The Federals formed line after line, only to
see them crushed and broken, while weary fugitives,
driven by increasing fear, pushed on with all their
remaining strength, to find some place of safety and
rest. The Federals dared not stop for an instant during
the lengthening hours of the dark, dark night. With
sad hearts they kept up their flight, and when the sun
dawned they had reached Ripley, twenty-two miles
from the dreadful scene which long haunted the memories
of the vanquished men in blue.</p>

<p>At 3 a. m., Buford, a few miles from Ripley, came
upon the remnant of the Federal wagon train and the
last fourteen pieces of artillery. General Grierson, at
earliest dawn had attempted to stay the pursuit until
he could reorganize his beaten battalion, but Forrest
and his escort, with the 7th Tennessee, closed in upon
them, and they dispersed in the by-roads and through
the plantations. All semblance of order was gone. No
genius could evolve a complete organization that would
for one moment resist the foe.</p>

<p>The Confederates seemed as demons, relentless and
insatiable. All through the day and night of the 11th
of June, the tired Confederates followed, and, with
boundless energy, pursued the fleeing foes.</p>

<p>The retreat began at 4 p. m., June 10th. The next
morning the Federals were at Ripley, twenty-five miles
away, and the night of the same day, they reached
Salem, forty-eight miles from Bryce’s Cross Roads.
Nineteen pieces of their twenty-six cannon had been
captured with twenty-one caissons, two thousand
men, including the wounded and captured, and twelve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
hundred lay dead on the field of battle and along the
ways by which the Federals had retreated. It took nine
days to march from White Station near Memphis to
Bryce’s Cross Roads. The fleeing Federals had traveled
the same road in one day and two nights. No pursuit
was ever more vigorous or effective. Forrest gave the
fugitives no rest or peace. Changing his pursuing
column from time to time, he made every moment
count, the Federals scattered through the fields and
forests and the Confederates scoured the country to
take in those, who, forgetting the first principles of a
deserting and defeated army to keep together, fled into
the byways and through the wooded country, in their
mad effort to hide from Forrest and his avenging
huntsmen.</p>

<p>There was no reasonable explanation of the stupendous
victory. General Sturgis tried to excuse it
by saying the Confederates had twelve thousand men,
including two brigades of infantry, but the only infantry
there were, were Lyon’s troopers, who for more than a
year had fought on foot in the campaigns of the Army
of Tennessee.</p>

<p>General Sherman frankly said, “Forrest had only
his cavalry, and I cannot understand how he could defeat
Sturgis with eight thousand men.”</p>

<p>Later he said, “I will have the matter of Sturgis
critically examined, and if he should be at fault, he
shall have no mercy at my hands. I cannot but believe
he had troops enough, and I know I would have been
willing to attempt the same task with that force; but
Forrest is the devil, and I think he has got some of our
troops under cower. I have two officers at Memphis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
who will fight all the time, A. J. Smith and Mower.
The latter is a young brigadier of fine promise, and I
commend him to your notice. I will order them to make
up a force and go out to follow Forrest to the death, if it
costs ten thousand lives and breaks the treasury. There
will never be peace in Tennessee until Forrest is dead.”</p>

<p>The Kentucky brigade opened the battle, bore its
brunt for more than three hours, and this gave to five
Kentuckians a prominent and important part in battle
on that day. First came General Hylan B. Lyon.
Born in Kentucky in 1836, he entered West Point in
1852 and graduated in 1856. He first saw service
against the Seminole Indians in 1856 and 1857, and
after frontier work in California was engaged in the
Spokane Expedition and in the battle of September
5th-7th, 1858. On April 3rd, 1861, he resigned
his commission in the United States Army and was
appointed First Lieutenant of Artillery in the Confederate
Army. He organized and became captain of
Cobb’s Battery, but in ten months was made lieutenant
colonel of the 8th Kentucky Infantry. He led this
regiment at Fort Donelson, surrendered and was exchanged;
and became colonel of the 8th Kentucky.
At Coffeeville, Mississippi, he acquitted himself well.
In 1864, he was promoted to be brigadier general and
assigned to the corps of General Forrest, his brigade
consisting of the 3rd, 7th, 8th and 12th Kentucky
Regiments. They were brave, seasoned, fearless
soldiers, and were prepared with their distinguished
brigadier general on that day to give a good account
of themselves.</p>

<p>Edward Crossland, Colonel of the 7th Kentucky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
Cavalry, did not go to the front in this great battle.
Lawyer and legislator, he was one of the first men in
Kentucky to organize a company for service in the
Confederate Army, and for a year was in the Army of
Northern Virginia. A lieutenant colonel for one year,
he became colonel of the 1st Kentucky Infantry in
May, 1862. He was at Vicksburg and Baton Rouge
and Champion’s Hill with Breckinridge. He was with
Forrest to the end. He had the unfortunate habit
to stop the flight of a bullet in almost every conflict
in which he was engaged. Wounded again and again,
he survived it all, and was with Forrest at the surrender.
Upon his return, he was made judge, then
congressman, and then judge again.</p>

<p>He had been wounded at Paducah, and if he had
been at Bryce’s Cross Roads, he would surely have
drawn another wound. It always grieved him that he
was not present at this greatest triumph of his idolized
leader. This day found Colonel Crossland’s regiment
under command of Henry S. Hale. In the blood-stained
thickets, Major Hale won deserved distinction.
On one occasion his men hesitated, but he seized the
colors and ran forward, flaunting them in the face of
the enemy. No soldier could run away after such an
exhibition from his commander, and they returned
with exceeding fierceness and cheerfully followed their
valiant leader.</p>

<p>This and like intrepid conduct on this glorious day
added another star to Major Hale’s rank, and he became
lieutenant colonel of the 7th Kentucky Regiment,
a just tribute to a gallant soldier. Kentucky sent none
braver or truer to fight for the Southland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>
<p>Among the officers who proved themselves heroes
on that day, none deserved higher honor than Captain
H. A. Tyler, of the 12th Kentucky Cavalry. His
assault on the flanks and his charge on the rear of
the enemy were noble and superb exhibitions of the
highest courage. He played havoc with the colored
reserves who were protecting the wagon train. His
voice was heard above the din of firearms and at the
head of his squadron; he descended upon the black
soldiers with such furious war-cries as to chill their
blood and set in motion the retreat, which soon developed
into an uncontrollable rout.</p>

GENERAL HAMPTON’S CATTLE RAID,<br>
SEPTEMBER, 1864</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">General Wade Hampton, in the history of
the Civil War, must ever be acknowledged to be
one of the really great leaders. Of distinguished
ancestry and high personal character, and endowed
with sublime courage, he early entered the contest,
and it was not long before his aptitude for cavalry
service was so developed and amplified as to induce
the War Department to confine his talents entirely
to that branch. As the second of J. E. B. Stuart, he
not only earned renown for himself, but was also one
of the potent factors in helping his chief to carry out
his cherished plans and to win the conspicuous place
he occupied in the annals of the great war. To succeed
so brilliant a leader and so thorough a cavalryman
as General Stuart, imposed upon General Hampton most
perplexing tasks and placed him in a position which
would thoroughly try out the metal that was in him.
It may justly and truly be said of General Hampton
that he met all the conditions which surrounded him
in the arduous work which his talents had won for him.</p>

<p>By the summer and fall of 1864, the obstacles which
confronted the Confederate cavalryman had been
largely augmented. Living upon the enemy had become
practically impossible. Raids, in which wagon
trains, provisions, army ammunition and clothing had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
hitherto been so successfully captured, were now seldom
successful, and outpost duty and the punishment of
the Federal cavalry, which undertook to destroy the
transportation agencies south of Petersburg, engaged
all the time and the energies and more completely
developed the genius of the Confederate cavalry leaders
of the Army of Northern Virginia.</p>

<p>Supplies of food had now become one of the most
important, as well as the most difficult, of all the problems
which faced with unrelenting grimness the armies
of the Confederacy. The Federal raids west and north
of Richmond, and frequent interruption of lines of
communication about Petersburg and Lynchburg and
up the Shenandoah Valley, had rendered the food
supply uncertain. Three and a half years of war overwhelming
the agricultural sections tributary to the
Capital of the Confederacy, had greatly cut down the
necessary quota of provisions.</p>

<p>For neither infantry nor cavalry was there much
chance during that period to forage upon the enemy.
The lines of investment and defence between Petersburg
and Richmond kept the cavalry too far south to foray
for supplies north of Richmond. The Atlantic Ocean—free
to the Federals, but blockaded to the Confederates—formed
a water route ever open and impossible
of closure, giving the Federals perfect safety
in moving food and supplies upon the currents of
the mighty deep, where there could be no chance
for the men of the gray to attack or appropriate them.</p>

<p>General Wade Hampton, always resourceful, had
learned that on the James River, five miles east of City
Point, the Federal army had corralled a large herd of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
cattle, kept upon such pastures as had been left by the
environments and demands of war. Fortunate in the
possession of most trustworthy scouts, who were entirely
familiar with the topography adjacent to the
James River and the Confederate and Federal lines at
Petersburg, General Hampton knew with absolute
exactness the place where these beeves were being fed
and kept ready for Federal slaughter. He well understood
that in any dangerous and hazardous undertaking,
the men who followed him would never hesitate,
but would cheerfully go where he led. These men were
always well assured if he carried them into the midst
of danger, he had genius to extricate them with masterful
skill, and their cheers, when ordered to advance,
were the best response which a commander could receive
from the loyal hearts of his followers, and nerved
his arm and quickened his brain for great exploits.</p>

<p>To succeed in this unique and difficult cattle raid,
it was necessary to make an incursion to the rear of the
Federal army within a very short distance of City
Point, the headquarters of General Grant and his
subordinate commanders. City Point had become the
center of operations as well as the base of supplies of
the Union forces, and even the most sagacious and
cautious Federal soldier hardly deemed it possible that
Confederate cavalry could march in the rear of the great
army that then lay beside the James, or could, with
impunity, pierce the lines covering Federal headquarters
and drive off the large supply of beeves which had
been gathered for army use.</p>

<p>On September 4th, 1864, General Hampton set out
on this perilous undertaking. He took with him men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
who were tried and true, men who feared to take no
risk, to brave no danger and who were capable of
achievements deemed wellnigh impossible by those
unaccustomed to the daring enterprises of war. He
had with him General W. H. F. Lee’s division, Rosser’s
and Dearing’s brigades, and a hundred men from General
P. M. B. Young and General Dunnovant. W. H. F.
Lee’s division was composed of three brigades: General
Beale’s, General Barringer’s and General Dearing’s—the
last named having only one regiment and one
battalion! There could be little choice among those
who composed the cavalry of the Army of Northern
Virginia. They were all and always to be depended
upon. In this extraordinary expedition, those who were
chosen were measured not so much by the individual
courage they possessed above their fellows, as by the
condition of the animals to be subjected to such extreme
hardship as awaited the expedition.</p>

<p>The three thousand men mustering for this foray
were told only that the service was both daring and
important. These men did not deem it necessary
to inquire where they were going and what the service
was. They knew that Hampton planned, that Lee
and Rosser, Beale, Young, Dunnovant, Barringer
and Dearing aided their chivalrous commander, and
they had sublime faith in the skill, as well as the courage,
of these intrepid leaders. There is something
in the cavalry march that exhilarates men, stirring
and stimulating the spirit of adventure. Visions of
glory give quickened powers to the men who ride to
war. Those who composed the long line behind General
Hampton were cheerful, patient and hopeful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
and inspired by patriotism and courage, they rode out
southeastwardly with the confidence born of chivalry
and implicit belief in the ultimate success of their cause.</p>

<p>After a march of thirty miles southeastwardly, the
little army bivouacked at what was known as Wilkinson’s
Grove. Undiscovered, they had now traveled
eastwardly far enough to steer clear of the extended
lines of the Federal army which lay between them and
the ocean. With the break of day, the march was
resumed. The heads of the horses were now turned
north, and before daylight had receded the adventurous
command had reached the Black Water River. These
movements had brought General Hampton entirely
around the left flank of the Federals, and he had now
come close to the place where he had intended to force
the enemy’s lines. The bridges had long since been
destroyed, and it was necessary to erect temporary
structures. There was no rest for the engineers or
their assistants. They had ridden all day, but now they
must work all night. A torch here and there was occasionally
lighted to help the men adjust a refractory
timber, but in the velvety darkness of the still night,
cheerfully and heroically, these brave men hurriedly
erected a rude bridge across the stream, whose currents
flowed between the narrow banks, as if to defy or delay
these patriots in their efforts to provide food for their
hungry comrades, who, in their beleaguered tents
around Petersburg, were longing and watching for
supplies which would give them strength to still withstand
the vigorous assaults of an ever-watchful and
aggressive foe.</p>

<p>Leaving only the pickets on watch, the command<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
bivouacked upon the ground, and horses and men in
mingled masses—side by side—slept until midnight.
Cooked rations had been brought with them, and no
camp fires were kindled which might reveal their
presence. No trumpet or bugle sound was used to wake
the soldiers, the low-spoken commands of the officers
instantly aroused the slumbering troopers whose ears
were quick to hear the low but stern orders of those
who called them to renew their wearying march.
Long before the darkest hours that precede the dawn,
the men mounted, and before the sun had risen had
ridden the nine miles which lay between the bridge
and the largest detachment of the enemy’s cavalry,
which guarded the pasturing cattle. The coveted
beeves were feeding just two miles farther on.</p>

<p>North and south, there were several bodies of
Federal horsemen, but General Hampton believed that
if he could distance the larger force it would prevent
the small detachments from having any base upon
which to concentrate. To General Rosser, always
spirited, gallant and aggressive, was assigned the duty
of making an assault upon this force, and he was ordered
immediately after the dispersal of the Federals
to corral and drive the cattle away.</p>

<p>The march from the bivouac where the Confederate
cavalry had rested and obtained a few hours’ sleep,
consumed five hours, but before the sun had well risen,
Rosser attacked with fiercest energy. To General Lee
was assigned driving in the videttes. A cavalry regiment
from the District of Columbia, as soon as attacked,
entrenched itself behind barricades and gave
notice that they proposed to dispute Rosser’s right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
of way and to resist him to the last. The coming of
light had renewed the enthusiasm of the horsemen,
and with the rising sun, their courage rose to the sublimest
heights. This feeling of determination to win at
all hazards permeated the entire Confederate commands,
and when Rosser called for sharp, impetuous,
decisive, gallant service, his men rode and rushed over
all obstacles, and in a very few moments defeated the
Federal command opposing them, all that were not
killed or captured riding off in wild dismay.</p>

<p>General W. H. F. Lee and General Dearing were
directed to disperse and ride down everything which
wore a Federal uniform wherever met with. Pickets,
troops, regiments, whatever opposed, and wherever
opposing, they were to assault and drive away. Particularly
were they to look after couriers, who might bear
any messages to Federal commanders of the presence
of these headlong and apparently reckless Confederates.
In fact, a courier was captured and a dispatch taken
from him, giving the exact location of the herd, which
had been moved only the day before.</p>

<p>As soon as General Rosser had dispersed the
detachments of Federals which he was ordered to destroy,
he immediately dispatched a portion of his command
to secure the cattle, which was done without either
delay or difficulty. The guards, panic-stricken by the
presence of enemies whom they thought were forty
miles away, were overpowered and made prisoners
before they realized that Confederates were in their
midst. A few horses and all the beeves, numbering
2,486, were corralled. There was no time for parley,
delay, congratulations or cheers. Safety required an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
immediate movement southward and away from the
presence of the numerous Union forces, who would soon
learn of this bold and aggressive raid and set about the
punishment of the audacious aggressors. But the spirit
of war and destruction could not be stilled. Dangers
could not deter the cavalry from proceeding to burn
camps, to destroy great quantities of supplies, and
immense storehouses of clothing and provisions.
There was many times more than enough to meet
all the wants of the foraging troopers. They were quick
to appropriate such of the enemy’s goods as met their
needs, and then the torch did its destructive work and
rendered useless the immense stores of food, clothing
and munitions of war which Federal foresight had garnered
and gathered for the use of the troops and camps
south of the James River.</p>

<p>The campaign was so mapped out and planned
that each man fully understood the duties he was
to perform. The secret of the marvelous success which
had so far attended the expedition was the result of
perfect orders communicated to the men who had
ridden fast and far on this splendid adventure. The
Confederate troops were necessarily scattered, the cattle
had been rounded up, couriers had been intercepted,
videttes had been driven away. These movements
covered a large territory, but it was all done so systematically
and so thoroughly that it looked as if some
machine had been adjusted and set for this task. There
had been no mistake in the distribution of the orders,
and no officer or man failed to carry them out. The
troops were elated by their superb success. Their
victory lifted them to the greatest heights of enthusiasm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
and its glory seemed to fill the very air and yet, amid
all the fascination of their splendid success, prudence
told everybody that now was the hour of their extremest
peril, and that the greatest task of all, that of driving
away this splendid herd of cattle and delivering them
to the Confederate commissary, was yet to be
accomplished.</p>

<p>It was a trying work to which these soldiers were
now subjected, but one which the experience and courage
of these men had fully trained them to perform.</p>

<p>In the later months of the war, the sphere of action
of the cavalry became very much broadened. Earlier,
raiding and scouting had been their chief business, but
now in emergencies they were used, not only as cavalry,
but as infantry; and their lengthy military training
fitted them to perform their part as soldiers in any
enterprise and in any line of service. Extraordinary
scenes were now witnessed, for the situation was weird
in the extreme. The beeves, alarmed by the shouts of
the soldiers and the firing, had become frightened and
unmanageable, for their new masters were not only
strangely garbed but acted in a way that they had never
before witnessed. To quiet the beasts in this emergency,
the Federal herders were called upon, whom the terrified
animals recognized as their former masters and keepers,
while they looked with fear and suspicion upon the
noisy and dust-stained cavaliers who now claimed them
as their property.</p>

<p>The Confederates soon found that if the cattle were
driven in one herd, the difficulties of moving them would
be much increased, their speed would be much lessened
and the animals in great crowds might become panic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
stricken, and so with the help of the herders and captors,
three or four hundred cattle were placed in one bunch
or detachment; these were surrounded by the horsemen
and forced forward as rapidly as the condition of the
beasts would permit. Celerity of movement was one
of the important elements in this splendid enterprise.
No one understood this better than General Hampton
and General Robert E. Lee, and even down to the
youngest private this knowledge quickened the movements
and steadied the arms and braced the hearts
of every soldier who composed the command. Within
three hours from the time General Rosser fired the
first gun, General Hampton had accomplished all his
purposes and was ready to withdraw. With the self-possession
and calm of a great leader and without
semblance of fear or apparent solicitude, he began
the task of extricating himself from the dangerous and
hazardous conditions into which the necessities of
General Lee’s army and his energetic zeal had involved
him.</p>

<p>No Federal general or soldier had dreamed that such
a campaign could or would be undertaken. Even had
it been thought of, the hazard and the danger of it
would have convinced the most cautious Federal
officers that nobody could or would essay to enter upon
such a perilous and reckless expedition.</p>

<p>General Hampton, though, had friends who knew
of this brilliant undertaking. General Lee counted the
hours which intervened from the time Hampton formed
his lines and marched away. He knew that only vastly
disproportioned numbers could stay the men who rode
behind his adventurous cavalry associate. He could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
hear Hampton’s guns, but a soldier’s instinct, the telepathy
of genius, had whispered to him that Hampton
had done his work. He felt that failure was almost
impossible; that Hampton might be annihilated by
overwhelming forces, but General Lee knew the men
who followed the man, and so when Hampton began
his march southward the Confederate commander,
behind his lines at Petersburg, began a demonstration
upon the entire Federal front. With fierce assault,
pickets were driven in, troops at double-quick were
moved from position to position; the whole Confederate
forces were under arms, and so far as military foresight
could discern, everything indicated that General
Lee was preparing to make a strenuous assault upon
every vulnerable Federal position. The cavalry, left
behind with General M. C. Butler, also began to skirmish
with the enemy’s pickets and outlying posts, and
between the movements of the cavalry and infantry,
the Federal officers were firmly impressed that a crisis
in the defense of the Capital of the Confederates was
on and that General Lee was now going to force
a battle which would decide the fate, not only of the
Army of Northern Virginia, but of the Confederacy
itself.</p>

<p>Fortunately for General Hampton and General Lee,
General Grant was absent. He had gone to Harper’s
Ferry to consult with General Sheridan about a movement
down the Shenandoah Valley. Telegram after
telegram began to pour in upon him; he had hardly
time to read one before another was forced into his
hands, and they all bore tidings which disquieted his
calm. The Federal cavalry, which had been completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
scattered, brought in with them marvelous stories of
the overwhelming forces that had attacked and dispersed
them. Their distorted imaginations had increased
the numbers of Confederate troops until it
appeared to them that every man in General Lee’s army
had been mounted and was charging down upon the
lines about City Point with a fierceness that indicated
that the furies had been turned loose and that the
unleashed dogs of war were ready to attack all that
could oppose them. The communications which had
passed between General Meade and General Grant and
the Federal subordinates during this period are most
amusing. The quick and unexpected onslaught had
completely dismayed the Federal Army. Its officers
believed that so much ado being made along the lines in
front could not possibly have occurred, unless General
Lee really intended some important and decisive movement.
Along the wires were flashed the stories from
the fleeing cavalry that the Confederate forces counted
more than fourteen thousand men. Those who were
sending these messages did not stop to figure that this
was more cavalry than General Lee had in his army.
Hour by hour quickened these fancies born of fear, and
each fleeing horseman painted in more lurid terms the
pursuing foes, which they declared were close behind.
The gunboats were ordered to cover City Point for
the defense of the immense supplies there stored.
Reserved troops were quickly pushed forward, and a
universal spirit of alarm and uncertainty prevailed
throughout the Federal camps.</p>

<p>In a few hours, the results of General Hampton’s
incursion dawned upon the Federal leaders. Chagrined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
and surprised at the success of the Confederates, and
determined to punish and resent their temerity, vigorous
measures were taken to release the cattle and disperse
or annihilate their captors. They understood that the
march and drive of the cattle would be difficult and
slow, that the Confederates had the long line and their
pursuers the short one.</p>

<p>The Federal cavalry, under Generals Kautz, Gregg,
Davies, all ambitious and restive under the just criticism
of their superiors for permitting such a coup, with
fierce resolution and quickened energy, set their followers
in motion and hunted their receding foes.</p>

<p>General Rosser had the cattle and could protect the
narrow line along which he was passing. His brigade
was a wall of fire in his immediate rear, but the converging
pursuers from the north and west, quickened
at every step by the appeals of their officers to avenge
what they regarded as an affront, must be held back
by Generals W. H. F. Lee and Dearing. Those who
followed these officers always gave a good account of
themselves, and General Lee, while active in his retreat
(an activity strictly limited by General Rosser’s ability
to move the cattle), while not seeking battle, stood
with iron will between their hot pursuit and the coveted
droves, which were forced to their utmost speed by the
whips of the captive drovers and the shouts and belaboring
of the bold horsemen whose every stride was
haunted by the fear of the following Federal cavalry,
now galloping to punish the audacity of the Confederate
raid.</p>

<p>With eager eyes and ears, General Lee and General
Dearing scanned every angle of the horizon, and every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
sound that passed southward, every cloud of dust that
rose heavenward, every object that dimmed the perspective
was scrutinized with earnest gaze. Eyes and
glasses united in finding the position of every coming
foe, and the quick ears of these trained horsemen were
turned to catch each breeze, and to detect if possible
the earliest tidings of those who were bent upon their
destruction.</p>

<p>General Hampton rose to the call of the hour.
Anxious well he might be, but despite the throbbings of
a heart aroused to mightiest effort, he bore himself
with the calmness of a skilled leader and fearless soldier.
To him and those he led, the issues were momentous.
Capture, imprisonment, the humiliation of defeat and
the loss of prestige, were grievous burdens to carry,
but behind him there was a splendid past and before
him a future big with patriotic hope, and he waited the
orderings of fate with sublimest confidence.</p>

<p>Along his lines he rode with words of encouragement
and cheer, and none could discern in his demeanor the
tumult of dread that disquieted his soul. No word or
act of his was necessary to tell the men who with unquestioning
loyalty were ready to do his bidding the
grave dangers of the hour. Intelligent and watchful
they shared with their leader the knowledge that the
situation was fraught with utmost peril and that nothing
short of the noblest courage, quickest perception and
unfailing steadiness could avert threatening disaster.</p>

<p>Hampton, Lee, Rosser and Dearing were splendid
leaders, they had with them great soldiers, and combined
they wrested from fate a great victory. General
Davies was the only Federal cavalryman that was able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
to force any sort of a battle, but General Lee was quick
to resist his interference. Halting to feel General Lee’s
line, Davies and Gregg sent a flanking detachment to
strike the retreating columns five miles away, but when
they came the Confederates were gone and this proved
the last real attempt to stop the march of Hampton’s
forces.</p>

<p>General Hampton, the master mind of this splendid
movement, by the aid of his faithful scouts and ever
alert guides, kept fully in touch with each part of the
ever-changing field. Self-reliant, confident of his soldiers,
and a believer in his ability and destiny, nothing
escaped his oversight and care. If he feared, none knew
it. If his brave heart ever trembled, there was no
external sign of his apprehension, and his unruffled
countenance was a constant inspiration to those who,
if needs be, would follow to death at his call, and who
had not even a momentary doubt of his ability to safely
deliver them from the tremendous risks of the hour
and the terrifying difficulties of their hazardous expedition.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/p083.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">GENERAL WADE HAMPTON</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Uncertainty as to the number of men engaged in
this movement dampened the ardor of the attacking
Federal cavalry. They did not know really what to
expect. They could hardly believe that a force so small
would have dared strike their rear, and if it was as large
as military science suggested, they had no real taste
for grappling a foe equal in numbers to their own. Lee
and Rosser were fighting the Federal cavalry and holding
them at bay. The cattle, now divided, with soldiers
and herdsmen pressing them forward, were traveling
farther and farther south. The hours no doubt seemed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>long to the Confederate horsemen, but the excitement
of the battle and the presence of the enemy had sustained
them through all the experiences of the day.
With such mental surroundings, minutes had greatly
lengthened, and all the Confederates were glad when
they saw a little ahead of them Nottoway River
and recognized that Freeman’s Ford, where they were
to pass that stream, was safe from the enemy’s grip. As
the lowing beasts, the shouting drivers, the tired riders
and the weary horses took the stream and passed safely
over to the other side, to a point where they were safe
from attack, generals, line officers and privates took
renewed strength and all congratulated each other that
a kindly providence had guided their feet and brought
them safely under the protecting wing of the legions
of infantry and artillery, for whose sustenance they had
endured such tremendous suffering and faced such
extraordinary dangers.</p>

<p>Hampton, with his matchless courage, felt that his
full task had not been performed, and leaving the beasts
to browse and later under lessened guards to pursue
their journey leisurely towards General Lee’s fortified
camp, he, himself, summoning such of his followers as
were yet able to ride to still greater tasks, recrossed
the stream and began, now tigerlike, to hunt his pursuers.
He felt that these men, who had had the temerity
to pursue him and his great commissary stores,
should be punished for their audacity, and so, turning
northward, he set out to search for the enemies who had
attempted to take from him the rich prizes which his
superb intrepidity and magnificent daring had won for
the Confederate army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>The Federal cavalry, far from their infantry supports
and with magnified ideas of the strength of the
Confederate forces, were not impatient to try conclusions
with the Confederate troopers who had so
audaciously possessed themselves of their cattle, and
so Hampton’s weary men, with more weary and tired
horses, turned their faces in pursuit of the Federal
cavalry. They found that those who had pursued were
now ready to retreat, and the Federal cavalry was
willing to leave them alone to enjoy the spoils of victory
and the splendid meat supply which they had so
courageously won.</p>

<p>General Hampton and his men had marched a hundred
miles in three days, part of this time encumbered
with twenty-five hundred beeves; he was far removed
from the support or help of his friends, except so far
as General Lee, by his movements in the face of the
Federal lines, could intimidate the army which was
opposing him and which was creeping hour by hour
closer and closer to Petersburg and endeavoring day by
day to find the vital and weakest points in the wasted
Confederate lines. The infantry and artillery who were
keeping at bay the besiegers who were pushing forward
to throttle the Confederacy and wrest its Capital from
its control and to drive Lee and his army from Virginia
soil, upon which had flowed such torrents of the best
blood of the South and on which had been won such
laurels by the Army of Northern Virginia, heard strange
rumors that day, as the first couriers brought the tidings
of Hampton’s Raid.</p>

<p>Fatigued men and jaded beasts mutely appealed for
rest and sleep, and so when General Hampton found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
that his foes, unwilling to hazard a battle, rode away
northward as he appeared from the south, he gave the
command to face about, and by easy stages he led his
troopers across the river where they might, for a brief
while, enjoy the rest they had so richly earned and
receive the plaudits of their comrades, to whom they
had brought such needed and healthful supplies in their
extremity and hunger.</p>

<p>For a little while, it was impossible for the Confederate
army to realize what General Hampton had
done. The cavalry, always sufficiently boastful, were
not slow to tell of the difficulties and dangers of the
march, of the excitement and adventure which attended
every hour from the advance until the retreat.
They were real heroes, and there was no reason for them
to be modest about their exploits, and to the amazed
infantry they repeated, probably oftentimes with more
or less exaggeration, the experiences and events of this
strange, successful and wonderful expedition. Here and
there the infantry had questioned the steadiness and
courage of the trooper under fire, but as this famished
army enjoyed, with gratitude and satisfaction, the
delicious steaks which their cavalry friends had brought
them from the Federal depot, they assigned this commissary
achievement to a high place in war’s annals,
and accorded to Hampton and his troopers in this raid
unsparing and unmeasured praise. If General Hampton
had done nothing else than inaugurate, organize and
successfully promote this marvelous raid, he would be
entitled to high rank among the cavalry leaders, not
only of the Civil War, but of the ages.</p>

KENTUCKY CAVALRY FIGHTING WITH<br>
ROCKS, DUG CREEK GAP, MAY 8-9, 1864</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">General Joseph E. Johnston had one of
the most varied and eventful careers of any
general officer in the Confederate service. General
Robert E. Lee was born January 19th, 1807;
General Johnston was born February 3d, of the same
year, making a difference in their ages of fifteen days.
They were both Virginians, and graduated from West
Point in the same class.</p>

<p>General Johnston held the highest rank of any officer
in the United States army, who resigned to take service
with the Confederate government. Of the really great
leaders of the men who wore the gray, he was perhaps
criticized more than any other. Whatever were the
charges against General Johnston, he was always able
to defend himself with forceful ability, and with extreme
plausibility to present both his theories and the conduct
of his campaigns in a strong and vigorous way. Oftentimes,
a student of the history of military operations
will question, in his own mind, whether General Johnston
was really a great soldier, or an unfortunate victim
of jealousy, or a brilliant leader, against whom fate had
a bitter and lasting grudge. Whatever critics may say,
he maintained to a wonderful degree the confidence
and esteem of his men, and his Atlanta campaign will
attract attention through all ages and demand admiration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
for the man who successfully planned and carried
it out. It unquestionably takes high place among the
great campaigns which were conducted from 1861 to
1865. The seventy-four days that Johnston passed
in the immediate presence of the opposing army were
days of incessant fighting, great mortality and immeasurable
toil; and of such a character as to hold to
the highest tension the nerves and hearts of his followers.
Probably no officer who followed the stars and
bars ever had a more difficult task assigned him than
that which was given to General Johnston in northern
Georgia, in the spring and summer of 1864. General
Bragg’s failures, whether justly or unjustly, had called
forth the sharpest criticism, and while a great soldier,
he did not retain in defeat the love and faith of the
men he led. In these matters, General Johnston
never failed.</p>

<p>General Johnston was placed in command of the
Army of the Tennessee, by the authorities at Richmond,
with the distinct understanding and positive
order that he must advance and stay the tide of invasion
which was slowly but surely moving southward and
sapping the sinews and the life of the Confederacy.
All knew that if the Army of the Tennessee should be
destroyed, and the Federals should take possession of
Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia, with the Mississippi
River as a base, it would not be very long until whatever
may have been General Lee’s resources, he would
be taken in flank and rear and his armies annihilated.</p>

<p>General Johnston, while confessedly a man of genius,
was also extremely tenacious of his rights, and resented
what he considered a slight; and he did not hesitate in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
the most emphatic way to criticize that which his
knowledge as a general condemned.</p>

<p>The Confederate government, on two occasions,
at least, was forced over the judgment of its executives,
by popular clamor, to give to General Johnston most
important commands. Twice removed, he was subsequently
reassigned to the positions from which he
had been retired. In each case, and whenever removed
failure followed, he calmly and with the most
abundant reasons was enabled to tell those who deposed
him, “I told you so.”</p>

<p>It may be that General Johnston frequently asked
of the War Department what it was helpless to give.
He was wise and experienced enough to see the overwhelming
needs of the armies. He was sagacious
enough to fully estimate the power and strength of
the enemy. He loved the cause of the South so thoroughly
that he hesitated to stake its destiny on one
battle, the outcome of which was extremely doubtful.
He refused to risk the life of his country on a single
throw “of the wild, grim dice of the iron game.” Those
in authority charge that he was over-cautious and afraid
to take the chances that the surrounding exigencies and
dangers demanded, and that he put his own judgment
over and above the orders of his superiors. He never
realized that they fully appreciated and understood
the needs of the situation, and he never fully recognized
that those above him had the right to demand
that he should subordinate his judgment to the authority
from which he derived his power. He felt
that he had closer and more complete view of the entire
field; that he knew better than those five hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
miles away of the desperate chances they called upon
him to assume, and he believed that the South could
not afford to take such forlorn risks when by the caprices
of fate the life of the Confederacy was hanging
by a most delicate thread.</p>

<p>General Johnston had personal reasons which caused
him to distrust the fairness and justness of the War
Department in the treatment of himself. The order
in which the generals were named, whereby he was
made the fourth in rank, was extremely distasteful
to him, and he did not hesitate to say that he felt he
had been wronged.</p>

<p>His conduct of the Army of Northern Virginia had
given him much reputation, but in the momentous
struggle around Richmond, the cruel destiny, which
appeared to overshadow him, brought him a wound
on the 31st of May, 1862, when, humanly speaking,
victory was within his grasp.</p>

<p>He was succeeded on that day by General Robert E.
Lee, and from that time, General Johnston’s connection
with the Army of Northern Virginia ended. During
the term of his service, he was wounded ten times.
He was brave to a fault, but never to such an extent
as unnecessarily to imperil the life of a commander.</p>

<p>Many opportunities came, but the fair-minded
student must admit that, with the exception of Bull
Run and Seven Pines, he never had an equal chance.</p>

<p>The correspondence between General Johnston
and the authorities at Richmond shows that the government
had good reasons to feel that General Johnston
was not a very obedient commander. And while he
may have known better than those who gave the orders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
they considered it was his business to obey rather than
to question or complain.</p>

<p>From May, 1861, to June, 1862, General Johnston
was in active and constant service. He was often
charged with over-caution, but his admirers say this
resulted from his great loyalty to the South and his
eager desire to see it win its independence.</p>

<p>After his wound, on the 31st of May on the James
River, he was forced to remain inactive until the summer
of 1863, when Vicksburg was in peril—again his
country called, and he responded cheerfully and
promptly.</p>

<p>His campaigns in Mississippi and his failure to
relieve Vicksburg have been widely and sharply discussed.
That the operations in behalf of Vicksburg
and for the defense of Mississippi failed, could not, by
those unbiased, be attributed solely to any fault on the
part of General Johnston. He protested that disobedience
of his orders, by inferiors, marred his plans,
and on December 18th, 1863, he was directed to turn
over the army of Mississippi to General Leonidas Polk.
He was naturally not sorry to be relieved from a situation
that had been associated with so many embarrassments,
and in which there were so many unfortunate
misunderstandings.</p>

<p>The Confederate government again called him a second
time to take command of the Army of the Tennessee;
but he was relieved on the 22nd day of July, 1863; and
on the 3d of December, 1863, he was again instructed
to lead the forces which were attempting to stem the
advance of the invaders towards Atlanta, and the further
progress of which, into the heart of Georgia, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
regarded as an impending death blow to Confederate
hopes.</p>

<p>General Johnston, with his knowledge of equipment,
realized how inferior were those of his men to
the armies that wore the blue, and most earnestly and
insistently pleaded for better equipments and more
troops. It must be said that he knew better than any
living man the condition of the forces, which he was
called to command. The failures of his predecessors
only quickened his desire and hope, out of the wreck,
to win victory, and it may be that a patriotic spirit,
united with ambition, also pointed out to him in an
attractive form the fact that he was to save Atlanta
from the grasp of the Federal forces, and become the
leader in the West that General Lee was in the East.</p>

<p>There must have been a feeling of intense satisfaction
to General Johnston in the resolution of the
Confederate government to appoint him anew to the
second and most important command in the Confederate
armies.</p>

<p>Those who put themselves in General Johnston’s
place are bound to admit that he had some ground of
justification for his feeling towards the Confederate
authorities. We can look at these conditions more
clearly after a lapse of nearly fifty years, and even the
friends of the men who composed the War Department,
and the friends of General Johnston, are forced
to the conclusion that there were two sides to the
controversy.</p>

<p>When, on December 27th, 1863, he assumed command
of the Army of the Tennessee, General Johnston
undertook a Herculean task. From all the reports of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
those connected with the department, it is shown that
General Johnston made the best of the situation when
matters were turned over to him. General Johnston
had assumed a burden which would press hard upon
his shoulders. Persistently and even fiercely, he
called for more troops, more horses, more guns, more
feed, more men in the infantry. It was his desire to be
able to stop the invasion. He was not satisfied with
the meagre resources of the government at Richmond,
but asked more. When called to the command of the
defeated army, it was with the understanding that he
should make an offensive campaign. The authorities
felt that a Fabian policy was the forerunner of ruin, and
that Napoleonic methods, with even desperate odds
and chances, was the only plan which suggested or held
out the least show of victory. He had a right to expect
such resources as would give him some sort of chance in
the desperate battle which his country had called upon
him to wage. He was facing an army twice as large
as his own, probably the best equipped army that ever
marched on the American continent, commanded by
a general who, as even those who disliked him admitted,
was a great soldier, who had behind him practically
unlimited resources, against which General Johnston
was to go with comparatively few and badly provided
men, and he constantly and with increasing emphasis
made demands on his government for more troops.
The people at Richmond felt the crucial moment
was at hand and the chances of battle must be
risked even though the chances were very largely
against the Confederate troops. They said, in substance,
to the leader of the Army of the Tennessee:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">He either fears his fate too much</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">And win or lose it all.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So soon as the rains of the spring had ceased and
the roads had dried, the Federal general set out with a
force of eighty-five thousand men to force his way
down through Georgia to Atlanta; he had already gone
through Chattanooga, he was well on his way from
Chattanooga to Atlanta, and between him and his
destination only stood Johnston with as brave men as
ever faced a foe; men who were ready and willing to
die, if needs be, to save their country. The fierce
campaigns of the winter which had been imposed upon
the cavalry had weakened their force, many of them
were dismounted, and many more of them were poorly
mounted, and in that depleted condition were not
equal to the tasks that this important march was now
to lay upon them.</p>

<p>Forrest and Wheeler and their subordinates had
done all that men could do. They had pushed their
columns to the limits of endurance. Their presence
now became necessary to protect the flanks of General
Johnston’s army and stand off Federal raids. They
were too busy at home to justify attacks upon the
enemy’s rear.</p>

<p>In the first few days of May, General Sherman
began to feel his way towards the Confederate position.
The Army of the Tennessee had wintered at Dalton, a
place that General Johnston could not see was of any
strategic importance, but its surrender would mean
another disappointment of the national hopes, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
further impairment of confidence in the Confederate
forces to resist the apparently relentless destiny that
was pursuing the decimated legions that had so long
and fearlessly challenged a further advance into a state,
the possession of which was vital to the nation’s life.</p>

<p>Among the forces composing the cavalry of General
Johnston’s army was Grigsby’s Brigade, composed of
the 9th Kentucky, led by Colonel W. C. P. Breckinridge,
and Dortch’s and Kirkpatrick’s battalions.
These soldiers were among the best that Kentucky
furnished. They were largely young men from the
Bluegrass, few of them exceeding twenty-five years
in age. They had come out of Kentucky in July,
1862, and October, 1862; had now received more
than a year’s seasoning, and were by their military
experiences fitted for the hardest and fiercest conflicts.
They had left Kentucky well mounted. Grigsby had
been on the Ohio raid and escaped the catastrophe
which met General Morgan’s command in July, 1863,
at Buffington Island. A portion of his regiment and a
part of the 10th Kentucky Cavalry alone came back
from that fatal ride. The 9th Kentucky, under Colonel
Breckinridge, had not gone upon the Ohio raid.
Grigsby was one of the best of the Kentucky cavalry
colonels. He was born in Virginia, September 11th,
1818. He was just forty-four years old when he entered
the Confederate service; brave, determined, fearless, enterprising,
he established a splendid reputation, and when
the Army of the Tennessee was before Chattanooga,
he was given command of a brigade by General Wheeler,
including the 1st, 2nd and 9th Kentucky Cavalry and
later Dortch’s and Kirkpatrick’s battalions. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
retreat from Missionary Ridge, General Bragg designated
Grigsby and his Kentuckians to cover the rear,
and they did it with preeminent valor and intrepidity.</p>

<p>Later on, General Wheeler became so much attached
to General Grigsby that he made him chief of staff;
and in Tennessee, Georgia and the Carolinas, during
the darkest and closing scenes of the nation’s struggle,
he won superb commendation and became one of
General Wheeler’s most trusted and vigilant lieutenants.</p>

<p>The 9th Kentucky Cavalry was essentially a
central Kentucky product. It was recruited partly
during General Morgan’s raid of 1862, in Kentucky,
and was completed during Bragg’s occupancy of the
state, in the summer and fall of 1862. It was commanded
by Colonel W. C. P. Breckinridge who, when
a mere lad at college, won a reputation as one of the
most eloquent of the young men Kentucky had ever
known.</p>

<p>He had been practicing law four years when the
war began. In July, 1862, he recruited a company
that became part of the 2nd Kentucky Cavalry, under
General John H. Morgan.</p>

<p>When the Confederates returned to Kentucky,
under Bragg, Captain Breckinridge was enabled to
recruit a battalion, and this was subsequently consolidated
with Robert G. Stoner’s battalion and became
the 9th Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, of which Breckinridge
became colonel.</p>

<p>By December, 1862, he was in command of a brigade
in General Morgan’s famous Kentucky raid, which
covered the Christmas of 1862 and New Year of 1863.
Saved from the wreck of the Ohio raid, his regiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
was part of the brigade commanded by Colonel Grigsby
in Kelly’s Division of Wheeler’s Cavalry Corps.</p>

<p>The Kentucky brigade was engaged in many
brilliant operations in Tennessee and Georgia. Part
of it rode with Wheeler in his raid through Tennessee,
in Sherman’s rear. General Wheeler, in his reports,
was generous in the praise of the distinguished young
colonel, afterwards known as the “Silver-Tongued
Orator of Kentucky,” and representative of the Henry
Clay district for a number of years in the United States
Congress.</p>

<p>Two of the services rendered by the Kentucky
brigade are to be sketched in this book. First, the
brilliant fight at Dug Creek Gap, at the opening of the
Atlanta campaign, and, second, its work in capturing
General Stoneman, some weeks later.</p>

<p>The Kentucky brigade, at the Dug Creek Gap,
did much to give inspiration to the army under General
Johnston, which, while generally retreating, was always
cheerful and, even though constantly retiring, never
lost its courage or its fortitude.</p>

<p>This brigade was not overly fond of discipline,
against which there was always a silent protest; notwithstanding
which they were always ready to grapple
with any foe that fate brought across their path.
They bore the hardships of every campaign without a
murmur or complaint. In July, September, October,
November and December, no raids, however trying,
had been able to bring from these splendid cavalrymen
a sigh of regret or a murmur at the arduous work that
their country and general had assigned them. When
General Johnston, with complete reliance upon their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
courage and fidelity in the face of the most imminent
danger, designated them for a difficult and hazardous
service, they accepted it with great joy, and marched
out with defiant shouts and enthusiastic cheers to obey
his commands and fulfill his expectations.</p>

<p>While General Johnston, through January, February
and March of 1864, was appealing for more men,
more guns and more equipments, Sherman had orders
from General Grant to “move against Johnston’s army,
break it up, and to get into the interior of the enemy’s
country as far as he could, inflicting all the damages
possible on their war resources.” General Johnston
had directions to strike the Federal army in the flank,
attack it in detail, or do anything that, by a bold and
aggressive forward movement, would inspire the people
of the Confederacy with yet more patience and more
willingness to make still further sacrifices for Southern
independence.</p>

<p>As to how many men Johnston and Sherman each
had at this particular time, there has been much calculation
and superabundance of figuring. General
Johnston said that on the 30th of April, up to which
time no serious losses had been inflicted upon his
forces, he had forty-two thousand eight hundred
and fifty-six men. Some Federal writers insist that
the Confederates had eighty-four thousand.</p>

<p>By the 1st of May, 1864, the roads had dried sufficiently
to warrant an earnest advance, and on the 5th of
May, General Thomas, under direction of General
Sherman, made a movement on Tunnel Hill. On
May 7th, the Confederate forces were withdrawn, and
then commenced the famous Dalton-Atlanta campaign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>Four miles southwest of Dalton, on the great road
from Dalton to Lafayette, a little distance away from
Mill Creek Gap and Snake Creek Gap, was Dug Creek
Gap, a mere road cut out of the mountain side, and the
steeps rising up beside the road provided splendid
opportunities to resist those who might undertake to
force a passage over the mountain by this narrow
precipitous defile. It was not a place to deal much with
artillery, but it was a spot where close range or hand-to-hand
fighting alone was to settle the conflicts of the day.
Oftentimes, the Confederate soldiers had marched
through Dug Creek Gap, and in February, preceding
Sherman’s advance in May, it had been seized by an
Indiana regiment, which held it until the gallant
Cleburne drove it away and repossessed it for the
Confederacy.</p>

<p>Dug Creek Gap had not been fortified and when,
on May 5th, General Sherman began his famous march,
it was guarded by a small number of Arkansas troops
under Colonel Williamson, numbering not more than
two hundred and fifty. General Sherman was constantly
and cautiously pushing his way southward. He
had three armies, under three skillful and experienced
generals: Thomas, with sixty thousand; McPherson,
with twenty-four thousand five hundred; and Schofield,
with fifteen thousand five hundred. These, like
the waves of the sea, were slowly but surely spreading
and reaching southward along the highway to Atlanta.</p>

<p>Starting at Bowling Green, not more than a year
before, it had gradually advanced fifty miles into the
heart of Georgia, all this while pushing the Confederates
before its victorious marches and incessant attacks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>It, as yet, had not reached its goal, and more than
one hundred thousand men had, by wounds or death,
paid the penalty of its fortitude and endurance. Composed
largely of men from the West, who were made of
stern stuff, the rebel yell had no terror for its legions.
When the rebel yell was given, there was always a
response, sharp, quick, defiant, which meant, “We are
not afraid, and we are ready to grapple with you in
deadliest combat.”</p>

<p>On the night of the 7th of May, Grigsby’s brigade,
after having been driven through Mill Creek Gap,
had gone into camp. The marching, fighting and riding
of the day had wearied all its troopers, now so far
removed from their Kentucky abodes. As they laid
down upon the soil of Georgia, tired and weary, they
had visions of their homes, and were reveling through
dreamland, in joyous anticipations of some day joining
those they loved in the far North. War’s sorrows, its
deaths, its dangers, its sufferings were lost in the peace
of sleep. These dreams were rudely awakened by the
harsh, shrill tones of the bugle. Turning over on their
hard beds on the ground, a number of them asleep on
rails and brush, they essayed to believe that the call
was only a fancy of weary brains and pulled their
blankets more tightly about their heads. They tried
to hope that the sound of the trumpet was only a delusion
and not a real command to rise and ride. They
rubbed their eyes and wondered why this untoward
night summons.</p>

<p>War, relentless, cruel and pitiless, turned a deaf ear
to nature’s pleadings for rest for her exhausted children.
Hesitation was only for a moment. The worn animals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
were quickly saddled, the Kentucky troopers mounted,
and out through the darkness of the night they trotted,
not knowing whither they were bound. Their commanders
had orders that they were to defend Dug
Creek Gap, eight miles away, but they kept the secret
of their destination hidden in their own hearts.</p>

<p>McPherson, young, brave, vigorous, was leading
the Federals; he was hunting for Snake Creek Gap,
some miles south and west of Dug Creek. A corps of
the Army of the Cumberland were covering these
movements and marching forward down the railroad.
Hooker was ordered to seize Dug Creek Gap, and then
push south, so as to protect McPherson, who, marching
west, then south, then east, was to pass through Snake
Creek Gap and strike the railroad in the rear of
Johnston.</p>

<p>The position at Dug Creek once taken would
necessitate an immediate retreat from Dalton, and
with this Gap in the mountains held by the Federals,
Gen. Johnston’s left flank would be severely exposed.</p>

<p>Before the break of day of the morning of the 8th,
scouts of the 9th Kentucky Cavalry had told the story
of McPherson’s flank movement and of Hooker’s
advance on Dug Creek Gap. To the experienced eyes
of the cavaliers of the Kentucky brigade, the large
infantry forces being massed along the line left no
doubt that serious work was ahead, and that Dug
Creek Gap was an important point and the key to the
present situation, and for its possession the Federals
had begun a vigorous movement.</p>

<p>Across Dug Creek, at the foot of the mountain, the
Kentucky cavalry had advanced north and picketed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
the road against the enemy. Eight hundred Kentucky
cavalrymen and two hundred and fifty Arkansas
infantry were to hold this now important position. It
was a difficult and a dangerous task, but these men in
gray felt they were able to answer the summons and
hold the defile.</p>

<p>Later, when it was dark (full moon), Granbury’s
Texan footmen would come up, but in May, in Georgia,
it was a long while from two o’clock in the afternoon
until the shades of night should cover the sides of
the mountains, and the sun would hide its face behind
the western slopes of the eminences through which
nature had cut the gap for the passage of man. So
strategic had this position become that it was now well
settled in the minds of the Confederates that it was
one of the doors into Dalton, and these thousand and
fifty fighting men were to hold it against four and a
half times their number, composing Geary’s division
of Hooker’s corps.</p>

<p>The Federal forces seemed impressed with the idea
that they would take the Confederates unawares.
They had not calculated the sort of stuff that made the
men who held the Gap. The Federal signal corps, at
the dictation of an assistant adjutant general, flagged
General Sherman, “The infantry has just formed and
started to attack the Gap. The artillery is in position
and I hope to be able to send you word within half an
hour or an hour that the Ridge is taken.” General
Geary admitted that he was assaulting with forty-five
hundred men, four and a half to one, without
counting his batteries.</p>

<p>The advance guard and picket line of the Kentuckians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
that had crossed the creek were slowly but surely
driven in. They retired sullenly, and at each favorable
opportunity stopped, turned and showed that they
were not disposed to run away, and with fierce volleys
disputed every inch of ground. The Federals had not
supposed that any important force would be there to
oppose their march, and when the thin line of skirmishers
receded from the advancing wave of blue-coated
marchers, they felt that the conflict was practically
ended, and that Dug Creek was theirs. Crossing the
creek and up the mountain side, the Confederate
cavalry retreated, until at last they found their comrades
and backers, the remainder of the brigade, awaiting
the final grapple on the mountain crest. The gray
line was thin, very thin, but what it lacked in numbers,
it made up in grit, and now that the limit of retreat
was reached, they set about the more serious business
of teaching the enemy of what material the defenders
were made.</p>

<p>The brave infantry from Arkansas and the chivalrous
cavalry from Kentucky stood side by side, and no
sooner had the head of the Federal column come within
reach of the cavalry Enfields than a hot and incessant
fire was poured in upon the advancing line. All through
the day, these cavalrymen had been hard at work,
but as the shadows of evening were falling, they were
less prepared for the vigorous and lusty attack that
was now to be made.</p>

<p>Up and up the mountain side came the men clad
in blue; above them the weary Southrons, long without
food, either for man or beast, were waiting
their onslaught. The Confederates had largely the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
best of the position, and they improved it to the fullest.
It soon dawned upon the Federals that, instead of
having undertaken an easy task, they had assumed a
most arduous work, and that their progress would be
resisted with great skill, unyielding tenacity and dauntless
persistence.</p>

<p>A sense of danger and strategic instinct had brought
General Hardee and General Cleburne to aid, by their
counsel and their presence, in the defense of this valuable
position. Intently and eagerly they watched the
Kentucky cavalry and Arkansas infantry face the
superior forces, but it was not their presence that made
the fighting spirit of these Confederates rise to the
highest plane—it was the fact that they knew they were
holding a stronghold of importance and that General
Johnston, over at Dalton, was expecting and believing
that they would beat back the foe.</p>

<p>Again and again the infantry assaulted the Confederate
line, but each time they were driven off with
loss. When probably the struggle was more than half
over, the ammunition began to grow scarce in the
cartridge boxes of the Confederates; in a spirit of more
dare-deviltry than intention to do any great damage
to their foe, some of the Kentuckians began to hurl
stones down the mountain side into the midst of the
Federals. It took a few minutes to catch the import
of this new style of warfare, but as the great stones
began to rush down steep declivities, gathering impelling
forces from every foot of descent, tearing the
tops of trees and breaking limbs and cutting down
saplings, the men on the hill began to take in the effectiveness
of these improvised engines of war. It is true,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
they had no catapults, like the Romans of old, with
which to fling them far down the mountain, but they
had strong arms, guided by brave and fearless hearts.
They caught, with soldierly impulse and sagacity, the
effectiveness of this new plan of defence, and stone
after stone was seized and sent crashing below, until
along the whole line went up the shout, “Throw down
the rocks, throw down the rocks,” and a great hail of
stones began to fly from the heights and sides of the
eminence into and through the ranks of the ascending
Federal legions.</p>

<p>General Geary, under whose immediate order the
assault was made, in his report, said, “Hand to hand
encounters took place, and stones as well as bullets
became elements in the combat.”</p>

<p>For a little while, the Federals thought that these
stones were cast down by accident, that some soldier
by a misstep had turned them loose. But quicker and
faster and fiercer fell the stone storm, and with terror
they realized that their enemies above them were turning
loose these strange emissaries of death, and their
souls and hearts were shadowed with a touch of panic
at this new method of defending the pass, adopted by
their enterprising foes.</p>

<p>With diminishing ammunition, but yet without
decreasing courage, the fierce and unequal contest was
maintained. Those who had no cartridges threw down
the stones. Those who had cartridges sent bullets
below to stop the advance of the brave and adventurous
assailants.</p>

<p>In a little while, the gloom of night began to brood
over the baleful scenes around Dug Creek Gap. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
darkness finally set in, the stone-throwing cavalry and
infantry heard the rebel yell creeping up the southern
mountain side. In their rear, closer and closer, the inspiring
voices sounded. They wondered from whence
the gladdening sound came, and who were these
assailants, from whose vigorous lungs, were speeding
messages of help and cheer, and bidding them still
longer defy their foes. They heard the tramp of horses,
the rush of horsemen, and the cry of battle. And, in a
little while, up from the mountain on the southern
slope emerged Granbury’s Texan Infantry. These
men were born horsemen. They had all their lives ridden
across the prairies of Texas, and they were at home
in the saddle.</p>

<p>Under orders from General Cleburne and General
Hardee, the infantry had been rushed forward to carry
encouragement and bring succor to these valiant Kentuckians
and Arkansans who, with such superb courage
and unlimited patience, were defending the Gap with
unfaltering vigor.</p>

<p>As the Texans at double-quick speeded to the scene
of the conflict, at the foot of the slope they saw, in
charge of the horse holders, the steeds of the cavalry,
who had dismounted to go forward on the mountain
height to battle. With a wild whoop, the astonished
horse holders were commanded to turn their bridles
loose, and upon the steeds, waiting now through the
long day for their riders to come, at once sprung these
sturdy, brave and resolute Texans. Mounted in the
saddle once more, they felt war’s delirium and seemed
to catch the spirit of the chainless winds that swept
across the prairies of their state, and shouting and yelling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
they galloped forward at a breakneck speed to the
succor of their hard-pressed comrades on the mountain
top.</p>

<p>For a little while, the dismounted cavalry could not
understand the changed situation. They looked upon
the animals and knew they were theirs, but they had
strange riders, the saddles were filled with soldiers
they had never seen before, whose names they could
not call, whose regiment they could not distinguish.
But the Texans had come for war and, quickly dismounting,
they turned over the steeds of the Kentucky
men to their rightful but tired owners, and took
position in the battle line in Dug Gap to defend its
now renowned and blood-stained heights. They had
come to succor and to relieve these Kentucky and Arkansas
soldiers, who for twenty-four hours had known
neither rest nor food. They had come to tell them to
go down the mountain side, and in sleep recuperate
their wasted and tired energies, while they watched and
defended the place now made illustrious by their valor.
Granbury’s Texan Brigade came ready to share all the
danger of the place and hour, but the assaults were over
and the victory had been won ere they had in such
startling fashion appeared on the scene. In the darkness
of the night, the men who so splendidly and so
patiently had stood throughout the day against great
odds, to save the destruction of the left flank of General
Johnston’s army, marched down into the plain below.
They had fought a great fight with the help of their
Texas allies. They had set a splendid example of
noblest endurance and heroic gallantry. They had
given the first notice to General Sherman that the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
he was to march would be a path of blood, and that
if he won, it would be at a tremendous sacrifice of his
best and bravest troops, and that in facing the oft-defeated,
but not dejected, Army of the Tennessee, he
was to encounter men worthy of any cause and whose
defense of their homes and firesides would dot the mountains
and valleys of northern Georgia with many thousands
of Federal graves, and if he did reach Atlanta, it
would only be when his losses would equal even those
his soldiers had witnessed at Shiloh, Murfreesboro,
Perryville, Chickamauga and other fields upon which
already fearful sacrifices had been the price of victory.
It was a success that declared that the Army of the
Tennessee had lost none of its courage and that in the
coming seventy days more than sixty thousand Union
men, in death or with wounds, should fall by the way,
on the road to Atlanta.</p>

<p>The Kentucky brigade and the two hundred and
fifty Texans had set the standard. Their comrades
would accept the measure. They had outlined the
manner of conflict that Sherman’s army must expect.
It was to be a series of battles where “Greek would
meet Greek,” and there would not be a single mile of
the entire distance to Atlanta traversed without the
copious shedding of the blood of brave and true men.</p>

GENERAL JOSEPH WHEELER’S RAID INTO<br>
TENNESSEE, FALL OF 1863</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">General Joseph Wheeler’s raid into
Tennessee in October, 1863, has few parallels
in cavalry campaigns. Removed from the
excitement and delirium of war, many of its happenings
appear incredible, and were it not for official reports of
both sides, the account of it when read would be
declared unbelievable, and deemed the result of highly
wrought imaginings, or the Munchausen stories of
some knight errant, whose deeds could not measure up
to the creations of his ambitious fancy.</p>

<p>Half a century between these occurrences and their
narration only increases our wonder and admiration
at the exploits of these courageous horsemen, who
seemed to have known neither fatigue nor fear in the
pursuit and punishment of their country’s foes. Viewed
from either a strategic point, or considered in relation
to the losses inflicted upon those who opposed them,
this raid stands out in military history as one of the
wonders of war, and assigns its masterful leader and
its no less masterful men a very high place among the
world’s cavalry heroes. Hard riders, fierce fighters,
insensible to fear, they hesitated at no undertaking
assigned them, and they never questioned, but were
glad to go where their gallant leader bade them march.</p>

<p>Wheeler, himself, seemed immune from death.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
Engaged in two hundred battles and in six hundred
skirmishes or smaller conflicts, he escaped injury.
Like Forrest, he led wherever he was present, and he
never hesitated to charge any line or assail any force
that came his way.</p>

<p>A partisan cavalry leader can never know fear or
doubt. His chiefest hope of success is based on the
surprise of his foes, and quick, reckless dash and bold
onslaughts make up oftentimes for lack of numbers.
A soldier, who at twenty-five years of age had risen
to be a brigadier general, at twenty-six, a major general
and commander of a corps, and a lieutenant general
at twenty-eight, and achieved such great success and
renown as General Wheeler, could neither be the product
of favoritism nor the output of accidental promotion.
Behind such rapid advancement, there must
have been magnificent genius, coupled with the fullest
improvement of every opportunity that crossed his
path. He had no real failure in his career. Victory
after victory came to him as if sent by a biased fate;
and a calm review of his life by a just and impartial
critic must force to the conclusion that he was one of
the most remarkable men of the wonderful period in
which he acted.</p>

<p>The Battle of Chickamauga, one of the fiercest of
the great conflicts of the war, was marked by an unyielding
courage, a sullen and intense obstinacy on both
sides. That engagement again proclaimed the determination
of both sides to fight out the issues which the
war involved, until one or both antagonists, in the awful
destruction of men and resources, should be unable to
longer continue the struggle. The results, beyond the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
immediate relief from pressing invasion, certainly did
not compensate the Confederate armies for the dreadful
loss Chickamauga involved. Whether the Confederate
leaders thoroughly improved the partial
advantages gained will remain an open question, but
the outcome imposed upon the Confederate cavalry
new and greater labors, which all history will declare
were met with a courage and enterprise, which added
new laurels to their hitherto nobly earned fame.</p>

<p>With Chattanooga still in possession, and with the
Tennessee River behind them, the Federal armies
now were to face one of war’s most dreadful foes.
Hunger is a most potent general that no antagonist
chieftain can ignore. Supplies for the Federal armies
were to reach them either by the Tennessee River, or
by the wagon trains starting from points on the railroad,
operated from the territory north in Tennessee,
and against these slow and tedious methods of feeding
an army, the Confederate cavalry were now turned
loose, to burn, scatter and destroy.</p>

<p>General Wheeler was given the entire command
of the Southern horsemen operating in this territory.
Barely twenty-seven years of age, wisely or unwisely,
he was given prominence over Forrest and other cavalry
leaders, who had on many fields demonstrated dazzling
genius and exhibited sublime courage. Brave and
patriotic as were the armies of the Tennessee Department,
yet as always where human ambitions and services
are involved, jealousy is bound to arise, and no
sixty thousand men can be aligned under a flag for
any cause, where some differences will not occur and
where in leadership and assignments some animosities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
will not arise. Some men are born to lead and some to
follow, and neither in Virginia, Tennessee, nor in the
farther West were the soldiers of the Confederacy
exempt from those ills that ever attend army organizations.
This was somewhat intensified in the army
of Tennessee, which by the summer of 1863 had developed
three great cavalry leaders, Wheeler, Morgan
and Forrest. General Wheeler’s youth made against
him in the consolidation of the cavalry by General
Bragg. His real virtues were obscured by the suggestion
that his almost unparalleled advance over the older
men was the result of official partiality, and not the
just outcome of military skill and his achievements.
For a long while, this unfortunate condition hampered
both Generals Forrest and Wheeler. General Bragg
saw the solution of this most serious problem later and
removed it so far as he could, but there are those who
think he unduly delayed action in so critical a period
and where transcendent opportunities were at hand.
With such a leader as General Forrest, at the time of
the October raid (which was led by General Wheeler),
also turned upon the enemy’s line of communication,
it appeared to the men of that time that only one result
could have come to Rosecrans’ army, and that would
have been practical starvation and annihilation.</p>

<p>These personal differences were at the most acute
stage when General Wheeler was assigned a difficult
and almost impossible task. It is but fair to General
Wheeler to say that, under these trying circumstances,
he acquitted himself with most commendable modesty
and delicate tact and, except in so far as he was required
by unpleasant orders, he did nothing to add to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
the seriousness of the complications then existing.
He was to accomplish a Herculean task, one involving
supreme risks to his own command and to General
Bragg’s entire army. The capture of General Wheeler’s
cavalry at that time meant calamitous results to the
cause of the Confederacy,—reckless courage, untiring
work and supreme daring, with quickest perception
and thorough comprehension of surrounding conditions,
made the call upon the young general such as
had never come to a man of his age before.</p>

<p>The events succeeding the Battle of Chickamauga
had placed upon all the cavalry, under General Bragg,
demands that were wellnigh insupportable and which
involved personal privations and soldierly effort, which
few men could endure. Both men and beasts had felt
the burden of these tremendous exactions during this
brief but important period. Less than two weeks had
elapsed since that great engagement, and from the
horror of its closing scenes the cavalry, led by Generals
Forrest and Wheeler, had known neither rest nor
release from diligent and vigilant service.</p>

<p>Horses, unshod and broken down, driven to the
limit of endurance; men, illy fed and emaciated by
the demand of those horrible hours, were allowed no
season of quiet, so necessary for physical recuperation.
Pity for their beasts, rendered dear to them by common
sacrifice and common danger, had a depressing effect
upon the minds of even those brave soldiers, now well
trained to the difficulties which war brings to every
brave soul.</p>

<p>It was under these circumstances that General
Bragg called upon General Wheeler to cross the Tennessee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
and destroy the wagon trains, which in long
white lines dotted every road north of Chattanooga
and upon which, for food and ammunition, the Union
forces were compelled to rely. Calling his subordinates,
and explaining to them the work that General Bragg
had mapped out, almost without exception they pleaded
for mercy to man and beast and for a brief season of
rest before such arduous and difficult tasks were
assumed. Not a few declared that it was impossible
to meet such demands and that to require such service,
under existing circumstances, was not only unwise but
inhumane.</p>

<p>One of General Wheeler’s marked characteristics was
absolute obedience to orders, and he never permitted
anything short of the impossible to prevent their
fulfillment. The quick answer to all these objections
was a general order to his command to prepare for the
raid and to cross the Tennessee River at once. In the
early dawn, with less than two thousand men, he forced
a passage of the river at Cottonport, thirty miles east
of Chattanooga, in the face of a force twice as large
as his own, and with such vigor did he press the
enemy, who stood in his pathway, that he captured
more than a hundred prisoners and brushed them
aside from his chosen line, as the wind drives straw
from its path.</p>

<p>Before the shades of night came on, two brigades
under peremptory orders joined him. They promptly
followed in the path that he had opened, and now, with
three thousand eight hundred jaded horses and tired
men and a limited supply of ammunition, he stood
alone, defying a great army both in his rear and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
front, and with a mighty river flowing between him
and his supports and comrades.</p>

<p>No soldier heart ever faced more difficult conditions
or assumed greater responsibility, and none ever met
them with calmer courage or more cheerful complacence.
His men measured up to the demand of their leader.
In the past they had always taken care of themselves
when beset by enemies and danger, and now, under the
valiant leadership of General Wheeler, sustained by
their indomitable will and unfailing gallantry, they
believed that in the end all would be well.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p119" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p119.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">WHEELER BURNING FEDERAL WAGON TRAINS, SEQUATCHIE VALLEY, JULY, 1862</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If there were hesitation and doubt, these were
immediately flung to the winds. There was no time to
scan the darkening horizon. Gloomy enough was the
outlook if they listened to fear, but fear these gallant
men had never known. Some spoke of disaster, but
the orders of their superior stood out before the mind,
and misgivings were quickly drowned by the prospect
of vigorous action. The brave man, seeing danger,
braces himself to face it and with resourceful powers
lays his plans to avoid it. General Wheeler’s pessimistic
advisers pointed out the consequences of failure
and gave expression to their serious fears of the result
of so hazardous and so uncertain a movement. Caution
suggested to turn back while the way was open, but
General Roddy, with his brigade, had crossed the
river some miles below, and if all the enemy should
concentrate upon him, they would annihilate his command.
The cavalry leaders of the Confederacy were
always faithful in the succor of their comrades, and no
danger could deter them from going to the help of
those who were sorely pressed. Stuart, Morgan,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>Forrest, Wheeler, Marmaduke, Shelby and Hampton
never forgot this cardinal principle of cavalry faith;
and Wheeler declared that he would not desert Roddy in
this emergency because of any risk that was open before
his vision, and bidding fears begone, he ordered a
forward march through darkness of the night in a
drenching rain. He had encountered a Federal regiment
of cavalry and, pushing these aside, the appetites of his
men, like tigers tasting blood, were whetted for still
fiercer work. On the morning of October 2nd, hours
before daylight came, he started out in search of richest
prey. One hour’s ride revealed the presence of thirty-two
wagons and two hundred mules and horses. There
was nothing General Wheeler’s command needed more
than horses, and those welcome additions to his mounts
were to his troopers sure omen of greater victories. This
capture was concluded before the full orb of day had
come to cheer the victorious marchers. As the sun in
glory rose over the mountain tops, from a lofty elevation,
there burst upon the view of Wheeler and his followers
a panorama of beauty and joy. Twelve hundred
wagons, with their covers whitened as snow, spread like
a gleam of silver down through the valley and across the
hillsides and over the mountain ridges, were crawling
along the highway, laden with supplies of the most
tempting kind and weighted down with ammunition,
designed to take the lives of the men in gray, brothers
of Wheeler’s followers, who across the Tennessee were
holding in check the Federal army invading the Southland.</p>

<p>To many starving men, with but scant supplies in
their cartridge boxes, and still scanter in their haversacks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
and now already aware of the but short delayed
breaking down of the steeds they were astride, this
scene presented an enrapturing vision.</p>

<p>But this glowing perspective had in it a gruesome
and darkening setting. A brigade of Federal cavalry
marched in its van and another in its rear, and to make
the work still more repellent, a brigade of infantry
marched alongside its huge serpentine body and behind
the infantry rode a third brigade of cavalry, all intent
upon the safe delivery of this precious cargo to the
Federal army, a few miles away, camped beside the
Tennessee River.</p>

<p>These Confederates had come out to hunt the tiger,
and it was no unreasonable or traitorous thought to
fear that the conditions might be reversed and at the
end, the tiger might hunt them. What Wheeler had
searched for, Wheeler had found. The game was
tempting if dangerous to play, and when Wheeler, in
the past, had come upon the object of his search, he
had never before in all his marches and campaigns let
it escape without a fight. There was neither time nor
occasion for arguing with fear. True, he was outnumbered
two to one, but he had never before counted that
too great odds to grapple, and so without even hesitation,
he bade his following go in. It was a long space,
and many times the Federal guard could not protect
at every point—it measured at least twelve miles.
Three columns simultaneously broke in upon the slender
line. The teamsters, never very brave, terrified by the
shout of battle and the din of rifle and pistol shots,
sought safety amidst the cargoes of the wagons, or
springing from the mules, ensconced themselves in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
depth of the surrounding hills and mountains and, from
behind stones and trees, watched the struggle for the
ownership of the huge train they had believed to be
safe from any onslaught. Contact with the foe had
been so quick and so unsuspected that neither they
nor their soldier friends had opportunity for introspection,
to figure out just what was best to be done
under the supreme scare that had without warning
pressed upon their minds. The Federal guards were
not disposed to run away without a fight. They had
no time to mass and General Wheeler gave them no
opportunity of combining, so as to get the fullest advantage
of numbers, and in hammer and tong style
both sides went at each other, by gage of battle, to
determine who should have the immensely valuable
train. The Confederates were a real hungry lot, and
their supply of horses greatly limited. They much
desired bread and steeds to ride, and the need of
something with which to shoot gave vigor to their
every movement. Hunger and the possible contingency
of walking are a great incentive to a horseman’s fighting
qualities, and for two hours the contest went vigorously
on. In this case the hungriest were the gamest.
They had also before their minds a well-defined fear
of languishing in northern prisons, in case they failed
to win, and with all this flood of thoughts coursing
through their minds, the men in gray fought with a
desperation that presaged victory, and after two hours
the Federal guards gave up the contest and retreated
from the scene of struggle. With a thousand prisoners
in the hands of the ragged, hungry, reckless Confederate
soldiers, the whole wagon train was at their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
mercy. The victory won, the savage work of destruction
was now at hand. War, always dreadful, was now
to witness most distressful scenes. The imagination of
countrymen and frightened teamsters magnified the
number of wagons composing this immense train.
Some said three thousand, some two thousand, but it
certainly contained more than one thousand, not
counting the sutlers, who, under the protection of this
numerous military convoy, were seeking the front to
realize large profits from hunger and want which depleted
army supplies would pour into their capacious
and avaricious coffers.</p>

<p>As General Wheeler had not much more than two
men to each wagon to be destroyed, the burning of
these became a gigantic task. The story of the engagement
would soon be noised about. Swift-riding
couriers would carry the details of the disaster and
in a short while, Federal reinforcement would be
at hand to punish these adventurous and daring horsemen,
who in apparent disregard of both prudence and
wisdom had journeyed so far from their supports and
so recklessly undertaken to operate in the rear of a great
army, which had two and a half times as much cavalry
as those bold raiders numbered and enough infantry
to watch and guard every ford across which they might
undertake, in their return to their own army, to reach
the south bank of the Tennessee. Needed supplies were
quickly pulled from the horseless wagons, rifles and
ammunition were seized from prisoners or hunted in
the depths of the “Prairie Schooners,” and then the
torch began its baneful work. Wagons, mules and
mounts for the victorious horsemen were safely corralled.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
Mules, now as the engines for handling supplies,
had become contraband of war. The dumb, helpless
creatures were ready to adopt the victors as their masters
and, without raising constitutional question of the
relation of the States to the Federal government, would
patiently take upon themselves the tasks and hunger
that the new ownership would demand. They could
help the enemy, they meant loss to the Federal treasury,
they looked with their innocent and inoffensive eyes
into the faces of the powder-grimed captors and seemed
in their docility to plead for life and toil beyond the
Tennessee River, in the wagon train of the army that
had risked so much in the change of their ownership.
Selecting the strongest, the largest and best fed for use,
the remainder were doomed to death. All things,
animate and inanimate, which could help the foe must
be destroyed. The supply wagons were all fired, the
ammunition wagons were reserved for later action.
The smoke of burning timbers, cotton covers and
harness sent up a huge signal that betrayed the presence
of an adventurous foe and wrote upon the very heavens
that fiercest destruction was turned loose. This warning
could not be stayed and so, if escape was meditated,
quick work must go on. The helpless brutes were led
aside, and those which were not to serve the new master
were condemned to a speedy death. A rifle ball at
close range was driven into the hearts of the beasts,
or, held by the bridle, a sharp bowie knife was drawn
across their throats. The command withdrew to a
safe distance. A few chosen messengers were sent to
fire the wagons containing the ammunition. A feeble,
flickering flame started as the Confederate destroyers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
ran to each wagon and touched its inflammable tops
and sides, and then, with a speed quickened by the fear
of a fierce explosion, the torch bearers fled in haste
from the coming dangers, inevitable from a combustible
outbreak. General Rosecrans, when the huge column
of smoke stood out against the sky, seeming to pierce
its very battlements, promptly sent out reinforcements
to help the guards who had in their custody treasures
of food, more valuable to his armies than a treasury
filled with gold. The Confederate horsemen stood
these off until eight hours had elapsed from the time
of capture. The whole earth seemed to feel the vibration
of the millions of cartridges that were exploding
with the fierce heat, and the bursting of thousands of
shells filled the atmosphere with their hissing tongues
of fire and shook the earth with their ceaseless detonations.</p>

<p>Ere the sun, which rose in splendor upon the mighty
train, as it wound its way to the relief of its friends and
owners, had set behind the mountain height on its
western side, the savage work of destruction was
accomplished. Its defenders were scattered. Its
beauty had vanished, only ashes and carcasses told
the story of its greatness and its destruction, and darkness
closed in about the weird surroundings, and the
fateful events of the day were ended; and Wheeler
and his men, happy in victory, well supplied, and with a
new crown of laurels, in the stillness of the night rode
away in search of other and new adventures and in
quest of more glory and increasing fame.</p>

GENERAL JOHN H. MORGAN’S RAID INTO<br>
KENTUCKY, JULY 4-28, 1862</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">At Huntsville, Alabama, John H. Morgan was
born on the 28th of June, 1825. He was descended
from Virginia ancestry, his father
having moved from Virginia to Alabama in early
manhood. His father married a daughter of John W.
Hunt, of Lexington, Kentucky, a man of wealth and
high standing. The father moved to Kentucky in 1829
and purchased a farm close to Lexington. At that time
his son, John H., was four years of age. The young
Morgan grew up proud spirited, brave, manly, enjoying
and rejoicing in the best things of life. He became a
very companionable man. He distributed kindness
wherever he went, and none ever came to him in need
and went away empty handed. He was extremely
generous in his judgment of men and sincere in all his
friendships. In military dress, he was among the
handsomest of men, six feet tall, weighing about one
hundred and eighty-five pounds, erect, handsome,
graceful. In uniform he attracted attention wherever
he went. He was a lieutenant in a Kentucky cavalry
regiment in the Mexican war.</p>

<p>In 1857 John H. Morgan organized a militia company
in Lexington called the “Lexington Rifles.”
Later, they became a part of the Kentucky State
Guard. This company was thoroughly drilled and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
comprised many of the best young men of the State.
Its uniform was handsome and striking.</p>

<p>It was not until near the end of September, 1861,
that General Morgan undertook service in the armies
of the Confederacy. He would have been earlier in the
conflict but for the serious illness of his wife, who died
in the summer of 1861. The authorities suspected the
loyalty of the State Guard and an order had been
issued for its disarmament. This was resented by
many of the companies and led a majority of its men
of military tastes to take sides with the South. After
concealing the guns of the Lexington Rifles, early in
the evening of September 21st, General Morgan left
Lexington with two-thirds of his company, and passing
through Anderson County, camped at Lawrenceburg,
twenty-two miles away. John Crepps Wickliffe, later
lieutenant colonel of the 9th Kentucky Infantry, also
had a company of State Guards, and these resolved to
take service in the Confederate army. Wickliffe had
captured a few Home Guards in Nelson County, and
this put him in conflict with the Federal authorities.
He united his men with those of Morgan and together
they numbered three hundred. The interference with
the Home Guards rendered further stay in Kentucky
dangerous. After two days’ hard marching, this force
came to Green River, which was then the dividing
line between the Federal and Confederate forces, and
here the newcomers were enthusiastically welcomed.
Captain Wickliffe attached his company to the 9th
Kentucky infantry, then being organized by Colonel
Hunt. Half of Morgan’s infantry had come out
mounted. The remainder managed to find mounts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
and there were numerous horsemen scattered around
the Confederate camps who quickly took service with
Morgan. In order to employ his men and to give them
experience and steadiness, he used them as scouts,
sometimes, on such expeditions, reaching fifty miles
into territory occupied by the Federals. During the
winter two other companies came to Morgan, under
command of Captain Thomas Allen of Shelbyville
and James W. Bowles of Louisville. These made
Morgan’s original squadron, which by the daring and
genius of its commander quickly won fame and renown.</p>

<p>In 1859 a railroad was completed from Louisville,
Kentucky, to Nashville, Tennessee, a distance of one
hundred and eighty-six miles. Its chartered name was
the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad. All the streams
in Kentucky run northward into the Ohio River.
The Louisville &amp; Nashville passed southwestwardly,
and in pulling away from the Ohio, of necessity it ran
perpendicular to the course of the streams, all of which
entered the Ohio or were tributaries of streams that
did. Salt River, Rolling Fork, Green River, Nolin,
Barren, Cumberland and numerous smaller streams
all traversed the pathway of this railroad. The topography
of the country through which the Louisville &amp;
Nashville Railroad was constructed naturally demanded
many bridges and trestles of great length. Few railroads
were ever built that offered better facilities for
destruction by cavalry raids.</p>

<p>A man of General Morgan’s boldness, intense
activity and prevalent courage could not long remain
idle. The enemy in front of him were the people he
had come to fight. All who wore blue were his foes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
To destroy lines of communication and harass and
kill these men was the purpose for which Morgan had
enlisted, and he was never idle when he could get permission
to assail and punish them.</p>

<p>In December, 1861, when he was a captain, he
won reputation by the destruction of the bridge over
Bacon’s Creek, twenty miles south of Elizabethtown.
At that time the immediate command of the Confederate
troops on the south side of Green River was
held by General Thomas C. Hindman. He and Morgan
were kindred spirits and he aided the cavalryman in
many ways in these incursions. General Morgan was
overjoyed when he received permission from General
Hindman to undertake the destruction of the bridge
over Bacon’s Creek. In this enterprise, he was compelled
to march for fifty miles in a country well garrisoned
by Federal soldiers. His squadron at that time
numbered two hundred. Apprehending serious work,
he took all his men with him who had mounts that
would pass inspection. Nobody could tell what moment
Morgan would be compelled to fight, and he
aligned every available man. The Confederate forces,
by this time, were south of Barren River and it was
thirty miles from the Barren to the Green River.
Morgan camped the first night a few miles away from
Green River, and concentrated his forces in a forest
on the top of a hill. He waited until night to resume
his march. He crossed the river just above Woodsonville,
in Hart County, and riding until midnight
reached Bacon’s Creek and was glad to find that there
were no guards. His followers at that time were not as
experienced in the destruction of bridges as they became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
later, but after kindling the fires and doing all in their
power to aid its destructive agencies, in three hours
the bridge crumbled into ruins and its burning timbers
told the story of his success. The results from a
military standpoint were not great. It delayed the
advance of the Federals a few days, but to Morgan and
his men it was a great object lesson. They now began
to realize how easy it was by these long marches to do
immense damage to the means of transportation on
which the Federals relied to supply their forces, now
slowly but surely making their way southward.</p>

<p>On the 20th of January, 1862, General Morgan
undertook a still more perilous task. With five men
he left Bell’s Tavern in Barren County, found a ferry
where he could cross the Green River, and rode into
Lebanon, sixty miles distant, with this small force.
Several hundred Federal troops were encamped near
Lebanon and there were many blue-coated stragglers
in town. Morgan rode furiously up and down through
the streets, destroyed supplies and paroled a number
of prisoners. Far within the Federal lines, it became
necessary for him to resort to strategy. He took
from the Federal prisoners their blue overcoats, and
he and his soldiers donned these and this enabled him
to pass where, if his identity had been known, he would
have been captured or killed. Unwilling to return
empty-handed after this hazardous journey, he decided
to bring with him five prisoners. Mounting
them on horses, he added to his trophies some flags.
He made a vigorous forced march. This was his only
hope of escape from the dangerous situation into which
he had fearlessly come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>Pursued by two companies of cavalry he brought
his prisoners and trophies to the banks of the Green
River and crossed it and turned the ferryboat loose,
as the Federals arrived on the opposite shore. These
two expeditions, so successful and accomplished under
the most difficult surroundings, not only tried the mettle
and the courage of Morgan’s followers, but gave their
leader a wide reputation for daring. Morgan thus
early acquired a taste for such work, which he afterwards
carried out on a much larger scale, and with such
success, which in a little while would mark him as a
great partisan leader.</p>

<p>Between the Green River and the Nolin River, or
Creek, was twenty-one miles. Morgan and his scouts
had become thoroughly familiar with every foot of
ground, and frequent dashes were made by them into
this territory. There is nothing can create so much
enthusiasm in a soldier as activity and success. The
entire command became confident and courageous in
such undertakings, and were impatient for their constant
repetition.</p>

<p>General Albert Sidney Johnston evacuated Bowling
Green on the 14th of February, 1862, and on the 16th
of February, Fort Donelson was captured and fifteen
thousand Confederate soldiers and a large amount
of supplies were surrendered to General Grant. A
few days later Nashville, Tennessee, was evacuated.
This transferred the operations of the Confederates
south and east of Nashville. From the ruins of Fort
Donelson, General Nathan Bedford Forrest had
brought out his command, and the Confederate cavalry,
under Forrest and Morgan, became a part of the garrison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
at Nashville, immediately preceding its evacuation.
When Nashville fell the Confederates moved back to
Corinth, Mississippi, and from thence General Johnston
advanced against General Grant and on the 6th of
April, 1862, fought the Battle of Shiloh. At the termination
of this struggle such a ratio of mortality was
exhibited as the world had never before seen. At Shiloh
two hundred and eighty men in every thousand were
struck, and twenty-four thousand dead and wounded
was the dreadful echo which came from this scene of
havoc, to tell the world the earnestness of the purpose
which moved and led the men who had entered into
the Civil War.</p>

<p>Change of locality brought no cessation of activity
to Morgan and his men. Two days before the Battle
of Shiloh he was commissioned a colonel and given
authority, which was to him far more pleasing than
rank,—to act independently. He had now attained
his chiefest ambition. He had a squadron of brave,
chivalrous, dashing young men who would follow wherever
he led the way and go wherever he told them to go,
and he could use them where in his own judgment he
could do the most damage to the enemies of the Southland.
In the Battle of Shiloh General John C. Breckinridge,
so wonderfully beloved by Kentuckians,
commanded a division. To this division Morgan’s
squadron was now attached. In this battle there was
little for the cavalry to do, but they performed every
service bravely and cheerfully. Morgan’s losses were
slight.</p>

<p>A little while after Shiloh, Morgan received permission
to make an expedition into Tennessee. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
force had increased to three hundred and twenty-five
men; marching with a swiftness that his enemy had
not time to calculate, he captured Pulaski, Tennessee,
and took four hundred prisoners. Later he made an
effort to capture the city of Murfreesboro. Here he
met reverses and it required some time for him and his
men to recover from the shock of this defeat. Later
he made a raid through Tennessee, reaching as far
north as Cave City, Kentucky. Early in the spring,
Captain John B. Castleman of Lexington brought a
company of eighty men, and in May, 1862, two cavalry
companies, commanded by Captains Gano and Huffman,
came to Morgan. With intense joy he saw his
command now increased to five hundred men.</p>

<p>Prior to June, 1862, no really striking cavalry raid
had been made. Small forces had succeeded in limited
forays, but they had accomplished very little, and the
panic produced by the appearance of such squadrons
was mild compared with what such expeditions would
later develop.</p>

<p>On the 13th of June, 1862, Stuart had ridden
around McClellan’s Army, making what was known
as the Chickahominy Raid. Before Morgan had heard
of this he had secured data for making an expedition
into Kentucky, which in the length of march, in the
terrorizing of the enemy and in the destruction of
property was to be one of the famous cavalry expeditions
of the war. A partisan ranger regiment from
Georgia, under Colonel A. A. Hunt, had been assigned
to Morgan’s command, and he now had, all told, eight
hundred and sixty-seven men. A few more than half
of this force were Kentuckians. Hope beat high in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
bosom of the Kentucky contingent when, on the 4th of
July, 1862, they rode out of Knoxville, Tennessee, and
took the highway for Sparta, one hundred miles
northwest. The portion of Tennessee then compassed
by the command was not in sympathy with the Confederacy.
It was mountainous, sparsely settled and
full of bushwhackers, who improved their skill as
marksmen by firing from behind rocks and trees into
Morgan’s followers. On the 7th of July they encamped
a few miles from Livingston, Tennessee, and by the
middle of the day following, the Cumberland River
was forded near the village of Selina. Tompkinsville,
the county seat of Monroe County, Kentucky, was
only eighteen miles distant and here was a portion of a
battalion of the 9th Pennsylvania Cavalry. Morgan
thought this would prove easy of capture. His presence
was unsuspected by the enemy. Sending forward his
scouts to investigate, he held his troops on the banks
of the Cumberland until darkness came. This gave
his men a few hours’ rest and at midnight he resumed
the march. He calculated that he could make three
miles an hour over the roads, which were extremely
rough. A short distance from Tompkinsville, Morgan
detailed Gano’s company and a company of Mississippi
rangers, under Captain Harris, to take the road to the
right and get in the rear of the enemy on the main
road which led from Glasgow to Tompkinsville. Just
after daybreak he found his enemies. They had intimation
of his approach and had made preparations to
give him a warm reception. A few volleys were fired,
and the 2nd Kentucky regiment, dismounted, assaulted
the enemy’s position. In a little while it was all over.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
Twenty of the enemy were killed and thirty wounded.
Some prisoners were taken, but Gano and Harris were
in the rear and put themselves across the pathway of
the fugitives and Major Jordan, Commandant, and a
portion of his command were made captives. Curiously,
only one Confederate was wounded. Colonel Hunt,
commanding the Georgia regiment, was shot in the leg
and the bone shattered. He was left behind and died
in a few days. Wagons, arms, munitions of war, the
very things Morgan wanted, were found in abundance.
As General Morgan set out with two hundred unarmed
men, this was a great windfall. Saddles and cavalry
equipments were found for many of those who were in
want of these essentials.</p>

</figure>

<p>It took some hours to destroy the property, parole
the prisoners, and at three o’clock in the afternoon
General Morgan set out for Glasgow. At one o’clock
at night he reached that city. These night marches
were hard on his men, but they mystified and terrorized
the enemy. The roughness of the road reduced the
speed to three miles an hour. Captain Bowles’ company,
of the 2nd Kentucky, had been largely recruited
at Glasgow. This made a glad and happy reunion
between a portion of the command and their friends.
Marching ten miles to Bear Wallow, General Morgan
rested until his telegraph operator, George A. Ellsworth,
could ride to the Louisville &amp; Nashville railroad
near Cave City and attach his pocket instrument to the
wires and get the necessary information as to the disposition
of the Federal forces in front. Heavy storms
of rain beat down, and the men as well as the mounts
were drenched to the skin. Riding all night, by eleven
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>o’clock next morning the command camped within
fifteen miles of Lebanon. For military purposes a
railroad had been constructed to Lebanon from the
main line of the Louisville &amp; Nashville at Lebanon
Junction. Detachments were sent out to destroy
bridges along this line. This delayed the march a little
while, but at ten o’clock in the night Morgan surrounded
Lebanon, and of the garrison, two hundred surrendered.
The forces sent out to burn the bridges between
Lebanon and Lebanon Junction had no easy sailing.
They stopped a train bearing a large number of soldiers
which had been sent to the relief of Lebanon, and this
brought on a battle, in which nobody on either side was
seriously hurt. At Lebanon great treasures were found.
Hundreds of Enfield rifles had been stored there, and
buildings filled with cartridges and ammunition of all
kinds which had been stored away. The two little
brass pieces that had received such rough usage over
the narrow and uneven roads, in order to keep pace
with the cavalry, were supplied with all the ammunition
they could need. The hungry were fed and the
badly clothed received unlimited supplies and the tired
horses, which had now marched something like two
hundred miles, were replaced, where necessary, with
fresh steeds belonging to the United States Government.</p>

<p>Colonel Morgan issued a stirring proclamation
calling upon the young men of Kentucky to rally to
his standard. These were sent forward by scouts and
placed where they thought they would do the most
good. Reaching up to Springfield, ten miles away,
another march in darkness was determined upon, and
after tramping all night, at nine o’clock on Sunday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
morning Morgan appeared in Harrodsburg. It made
but little difference to these men following Morgan if
night was turned into day. The moon and stars were
bright enough for their guidance and the well-graded
and smoothly-packed turnpikes made plain the paths
they were to follow and gave their horses, which had
suffered so severely on the rocky, mountain roads,
some rest after the harassing experiences of the five
days before. Here was plenty of southern sentiment
and southern sympathy. A number of Morgan’s men
had come from Harrodsburg, and the people were glad
to see a Confederate force. No time could be allowed
for reunions with loved ones. Marching part of the
night, the command reached Lawrenceburg, where
it was necessary to gather more information. Three
hundred and twenty miles had now been put behind
these adventurous horsemen. It was eight days since
they left Knoxville. They had averaged forty miles
a day. Ordinarily this terrific strain would have
affected the men seriously, but the pleasure and delight
of home-coming to the Kentuckians and the
excitement of those who had never been in the State
kept all the men as fresh and bright as the day,
when, with quickened pulses, they rode out of Knoxville.
Stables along the line supplied some mounts,
and the Federal Government had supplied more.
Captures had given arms and ammunition, a few recruits
had come in, and full of hope and full of courage,
there were now nine hundred soldiers; and there was
no nine hundred men on the other side that could have
stopped the victorious advance of this daring column.
The three and a half weeks allowed for this journey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
was so brief that extended sleep was not considered,
and at the dawn of day, the next morning, stock had
been fed and breakfast cooked and the column was in
line on the road from Lawrenceburg to Versailles.
Four miles from Lawrenceburg was the Kentucky
River. At the ferry where the turnpike crossed it was
not fordable. The ferryboat had been sunk; the men
quickly raised and repaired it. The whole country
was thoroughly demoralized and frightened by reports
of the number of men Morgan had with him, and the
sending out of detachments in many directions had
multiplied in the Federal minds many times the number
of his command. Kentucky was full, at the time, of
Home Guards, citizens who had been armed for the
purpose of intimidating the southern sympathizers.
These Home Guards made haste to seek safety and
refuge in cities like Frankfort and Lexington. Every
town was looking out for itself. The country people
would make no opposition, for the larger portion of
them were sympathizers, and so Colonel Morgan gave
his men a good rest at Versailles until ten o’clock the
next day.</p>

<p>Eight miles from Versailles was the town of Midway,
the halfway point between Lexington and Frankfort,
through which a railroad had long been operated.
This railway was used to run trains from Lexington to
Louisville, through Frankfort, a distance of eighty-three
miles, to carry soldiers to impede Morgan’s
march. The authorities at Frankfort and Lexington
did not know exactly where Morgan was and so the
advance guard rapidly entering Midway, captured the
telegraph operator. No cavalry commander ever had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
a more skillful telegraphist than George A. Ellsworth,
and he was a most important factor in Morgan’s
success on these expeditions. He thus tells the story
of his operations at this place:</p>

<p>“At this place I surprised the operator, who was
quietly sitting on the platform in front of his office,
enjoying himself hugely. Little did he suspect that
the much-dreaded Morgan was in his vicinity. I demanded
of him to call Lexington and inquire the time
of day, which he did. This I did for the purpose of
getting his style of handling the ‘key’ in writing dispatches.
My first impression of his style, from noting
the paper in the instrument, was confirmed. He was,
to use a telegraphic term, a ‘plug’ operator. I adopted
his style of telegraphing and commenced operations.
In this office I found a signal book, which proved very
useful. It contained the calls of all the offices. Despatch
after despatch was going to and from Lexington,
Georgetown, Paris and Frankfort, all containing something
in reference to Morgan. On commencing operations,
I discovered that there were two wires on the
line along this railroad. One was what we term a
‘through wire,’ running direct from Lexington to Frankfort,
and not entering any of the way offices. I found
that all military messages were sent over that line.
As it did not enter Midway office, I ordered it to be
cut, thus forcing Lexington onto the wire that ran
through the office. I tested the line and found, by
applying the ground wire, it made no difference in the
circuit; and, as Lexington was headquarters, I cut
Frankfort off. Midway was called, I answered, and
received the following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“‘Lexington, July 15th, 1862.</p>

“‘To J. W. Woolums, Operator, Midway:<br>
</p>

<p>“‘Will there be any danger in coming to Midway?
Is everything right?</p>

<p class="right">
“‘Taylor—Conductor.’<br>
</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I inquired of my prisoner (the operator) if he
knew a man by the name of Taylor. He said Taylor
was the conductor. I immediately gave Taylor the
following reply:</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“‘Midway, July 15th, 1862.</p>
<p class="no-indent">

</p>

<p>“‘All right; come on. No sign of any rebels here.</p>

<p class="right">
“‘Woolums.’<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>“The operator in Cincinnati then called Frankfort.
I answered and received about a dozen unimportant
dispatches. He had no sooner finished than Lexington
called Frankfort. Again I answered and received the
following message:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“‘Lexington, July 15th, 1862.</p>
<p class="no-indent">
“‘To General Finnell, Frankfort:<br>
</p>

<p>“‘I wish you to move the forces to Frankfort, on
the line of the Lexington railroad, immediately, and have
the cars follow and take them up as soon as possible.
Further orders will await them at Midway. I will,
in three or four hours, move forward on the Georgetown
pike; will have most of my men mounted.
Morgan left Versailles this morning with eight hundred
and fifty men, moving in the direction of Georgetown.</p>

<p class="right">
“‘Brigadier-General Ward.’<br>
</p>

<p>“This being our position and intention exactly, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
was thought proper to throw General Ward on some
other track. So, in the course of half an hour, I manufactured
and sent the following dispatch, which was
approved by General Morgan:</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“‘Midway, July 15th, 1862.<br>

<p>“‘Morgan, with upward of one thousand men,

reliable.</p>

<p class="right">
“‘Woolums—Operator.’<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>“In about ten minutes Lexington again called
Frankfort, when I received the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“‘Lexington, July 15th, 1862.</p>
<p class="no-indent">
“‘To General Finnell, Frankfort:<br>

<p>“‘Morgan, with more than one thousand men,
came within a mile of here, and took the old Frankfort

reliable. The regiment from Frankfort had better be
recalled.</p>

<p class="right">
“‘Brigadier-General Ward.’<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>“I receipted for this message, and again manufactured
a message to confirm the information General
Ward received from Midway, and not knowing the
tariff from Frankfort to Lexington, I could not send a
formal message; so, appearing greatly agitated, I
waited until the circuit was occupied, and broke in,
telling them to wait a minute, and commenced calling
Lexington. He answered with as much gusto as I
called him. I telegraphed as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="no-indent">
“‘Frankfort to Lexington:<br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>“‘Tell General Ward our pickets are just driven in.
Great excitement. Pickets say force of enemy must
be two thousand.</p>

<p class="right">
“‘Operator.’<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>“It was now 2 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, and as Colonel Morgan wished
to be off for Georgetown, I ran a secret ground connection,
and opened the circuit on the Lexington end.
This was to leave the impression that the Frankfort
operator was skedaddling, or that Morgan’s men had
destroyed the telegraph.”</p>

<p>General Morgan was the only cavalry commander
who extensively or successfully used the telegraph to
learn the plans and position of his enemies and to
thwart their arrangements for disturbance of his
progress, or to place troops in his front. The country
through which he operated did much to aid him in
this respect, but it was also due in great part to the
marvellous skill of his operator, George A. Ellsworth.
The story of how he misled his foes, and deceived them
as to his intentions and line of march, is not only one
of the most amusing but one of the most surprising
of the war’s happenings. He passed through four
years of war, followed telegraphy and died in Texas
about 1910.</p>

<p>The Federals were so thoroughly alarmed that they
were unwilling to risk engines and cars and men on the
road. Reports of atrocities and barbarities of Morgan’s
command were circulated through the country. They
were called murderers and thieves and assassins and
horse thieves. Bad names did not worry Morgan’s
followers. They cared little what they were called
if they could harass their foes. They settled down to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
a feeling of pride that they had been able to excite in
the minds and hearts of the enemy such bitter and
malignant hate. Neither Morgan’s nor Forrest’s
command were much troubled over Federal abuse.
They knew that if their foes cussed them, their foes
must have suffered to arouse such maledictions, and
they rode on and fought on, oblivious of what reports
were circulated about their doings. Those who did not
have southern sympathies escaped hurriedly from the
contemplated line of march and hastened to Lexington
and Frankfort for protection. Having obtained all the
information that was necessary, at sundown Morgan
appeared at Georgetown, the county seat of Scott
County, twelve miles from Midway. With Lexington
demoralized and Frankfort terrorized and with the
Federal commanders at both places afraid that Morgan
was going to attack them, he sat down at Georgetown
to have a really good rest. A detachment had been
left at Midway to delay operations between Lexington
and Frankfort, and Captain John B. Castleman of
Company D was sent to destroy the bridges between
Lexington and Paris on the Kentucky Central Railroad.
Captain Castleman did thorough work. He was ordered
to proceed up and down the railroad, tear up the
track, and burn the bridges. The country outside of
the cities was now completely dominated by Morgan.
Lexington and Frankfort were too fully garrisoned to
justify their assault. Captain Castleman, after fully
carrying out his orders, marched to Winchester.
These were ready heroes when the highest daring
was demanded, and the young men who served under
Morgan were equal to any emergency. On reaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
Winchester, after the destruction of the Kentucky
Central Railroad, Captain Castleman would pass near
the home of his parents. He had secretly entered
Lexington in disguise and obtained full information
as to the numbers and position of the enemy. Safely
performing this hazardous work, he rejoined his
command.</p>

<p>On the way to Winchester he ran afoul of the advance
guard of Metcalf’s brigade. Without a moment’s
hesitation he ordered his eighty men to charge the
three thousand Federals. The boldness and fierceness
of this assault demoralized the enemy. They judged
that no sagacious leader with such odds against him
would undertake such reckless work, and they receded
before the assault, leaving their dead and wounded
behind. The valiant young captain, not satisfied with
the morning’s experience, returned to Horeb Presbyterian
Church, a few miles away. Here his family had
worshipped for many years. Behind the structure his
command were hidden when a company of Federal
cavalry came down a cross road. These also outnumbered
the company which had, with such reckless valor,
dispersed their comrades a few hours before. With the
recollection of their previous splendid success, they
did not hesitate to assault this new column. Waving
their hats and filling the air with the rebel yell, they
rode at the advancing foe. Visions of Morgan’s entire
regiment flashed before their surprised minds, and
not waiting for the moment of impact, they turned
and rode away, leaving as testimonials of the fierce
courage of the Confederate assailants a number of
dead and wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>With these thrilling experiences attesting the intrepidity
of his boys, a large proportion of whom were
born and reared in the neighborhood, the youthful
commander withdrew his company and pushed on to
Winchester, where later Colonel Morgan found him
awaiting his arrival.</p>

<p>Morgan was now alone in the face of his foes. He
could depend upon no aid from his fellows. Insofar as
help was concerned, he had “burned the bridges”
behind him. There were none upon whom he could fall
back. He was as far from all supports as it would be
from Richmond to New York. The supreme audacity
of such a campaign had never been known before.
In no country, in no war, had any leader ever undertaken
such a hazard or invited such peril. There were
Federal troops three hundred miles south of him and
thousands around him. The way he had come was
lined with Federal garrisons, and urgent calls were
made for Federals to face him and equally as urgent
for those behind him to prevent his escape and crush
the little company he had brought with him so far
into the Federal lines. He was smashing all military
precedents. The books written for the guidance of
soldiers contained nothing like the history this bold
rider was making, and there was, in all military annals,
no parallel to what he had now accomplished. This
new soldier Daniel had come to judgment, and there
were none who could fathom or interpret his decrees.
Later, others would rise up to emulate him in the pathway
he had blazed. He was the pioneer, and the first
cavalryman who had undertaken such marvellous
marches, or defied the formulas and maxims that military<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
authors had written for the guidance of those
who went to war. Sage generals decreed him reckless,
rash, heedless and prophesied destruction, capture,
failure. They reread the books generals read and in
all these there was nothing, they said, for this knight
errant, but sure and certain disaster. But Morgan’s
great mind had taken in all the chances he must face.
He knew the country and the people whither he had
come. He knew the courage and almost superhuman
endurance of the youths who rode behind him, and so
he bade defiance to axioms and precedents and pushed
on where his genius and daring told him he would
win victory and discomfit his foes, make new records
for his horsemen, show others the effects of bold,
dashing movement, and give to cavalry a power and
efficacy of which the soldiery of the world had not
hitherto written or prophesied.</p>

<p>With Federal forces about in every direction, in
Frankfort, Lexington, Falmouth, Danville, Winchester,
Cynthiana, it looked as if escape was well-nigh impossible.
Morgan had now fully carried out his plans and
so he turned his eyes toward Cynthiana, the county
seat of Harrison County. It was twenty-two miles
distant from Georgetown over a beautifully-graded
macadam road. It was sixty-six miles from Cincinnati,
and if Morgan could reach Cynthiana and capture it,
this would still further disquiet and disturb Lexington
and alarm the people of Cincinnati.</p>

<p>A force was sent to drive in the pickets at Lexington.
This was promptly done, and the outposts went scurrying
back to proclaim the near approach of these desperadoes,
and while Lexington was vigorously defending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
itself from a present foe, Morgan was marching on
Cynthiana.</p>

<p>The Federal authorities at Nashville, three hundred
miles away, were frantic with fear, and Cincinnati was
in the throes of chaos and fright. General J. T. Boyle
was then in command of Kentucky with headquarters
at Louisville, and he kept the wires burning, telling
the story of Morgan’s performances. On the 10th of
July he wired General Buell: “The rebels under
Starnes, over two thousand, with three pieces of artillery,
crossed from Sparta, Tennessee, into Kentucky,
cut to pieces Major Jordan at Tompkinsville, and are
moving on Glasgow.” General Buell, calmer, tried to
allay the fears, and so he wired General Boyle: “Force
of the enemy doubtless greatly exaggerated. A regiment
of your cavalry, properly managed, will force
him to cross the Cumberland or destroy him.” General
Buell at this time did not seem to be acquainted
with Morgan’s ways of doing things. By the 12th of
July the situation appeared much more serious to
General Boyle and so he wired General Buell: “Morgan
has fifteen hundred men. His force is increasing.
All the rebels in the State will join him if there is not a
demonstration of force and power sent in cavalry.
The State will be desolated unless this matter is attended
to. The city is so endangered that I am bound
to keep force here. Send me cavalry and other reinforcements.
I know more of Kentucky than you can
possibly know, and unless it is proposed to abandon
Kentucky, I must have the force.” On the 15th of
July he telegraphed General Buell: “The secessionists
have lied for Morgan and magnified his forces. He has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
divided them up and is burning bridges on the Central
Railroad between Paris and Lexington. Only the
low and evil will join him.” On the 12th of July he
telegraphed: “The whole State will be in arms if
General Buell does not send me force to put it down.
Morgan is devastating with fire and sword.” On the
13th of July Mr. Lincoln telegraphed General Halleck
at Corinth, Mississippi: “They are having a stampede
in Kentucky. Please look to it. A. Lincoln.” On the
13th of July Mr. Lincoln telegraphed General Boyle:
“I have telegraphed him (Halleck) that you are in
trouble.” On July 15th Richard Smith, at Cincinnati,
telegraphed: “Danger of serious trouble here, external
if not internal. Men enough for emergencies but no
arms, no head. Military commander should be appointed
for this post. Press this upon Stanton at once.”
On the 19th of July General Boyle telegraphed: “The
boldness of Morgan’s raid gives reason to believe that
he has been reinforced and that they will fall upon
Kentucky in her helpless condition.” The mayor of
Cincinnati telegraphed that he had called a public
meeting. He wired on July 18th: “Cynthiana surrounded
at 5:30 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> Boyd Station, this side of
Cynthiana, expects to be attacked any moment.
Morgan reported to have twenty-five hundred men.
We have no organized forces here.” On the 19th of
July General Boyle, still more excited, wired the
Secretary of War: “There is a concerted plan between
the traitors at home and the rebels in arms. Morgan’s
force has increased. It is estimated at from twenty-five
hundred to three thousand. I do not believe it is
so large. Every species of falsehood is being circulated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
by the traitors at home, producing consternation among
the people to get the people to rise. Morgan proclaims
Breckinridge is coming with thirty thousand men.
Traitors throughout the State circulate it.” On July
24th Buell telegraphed General Boyle: “I approve
of punishing the guilty, but it would not answer to
announce the rule of ‘no quarter’ even for guerrillas.
Neither will it be judicious to levy contributions on
secessionists for opinions alone.... I approve of
your preventing any avowed secessionist from being
run for office,” and then so as not to show disregard
of the military situation, with a touch of sarcasm,
General Buell telegraphed the same day: “Is it true
your troops surrendered to Morgan at Cynthiana?”</p>

<p>It was impossible for any command with the limited
number of men composing General Morgan’s
diminutive brigade to maintain itself much longer,
surrounded as it was, not only by garrisons but pursuing
forces on every side, and from Nashville, Munfordsville
and Bowling Green, troops might be sent to
cut off his escape through Southwestern Kentucky.
These home-comers would have been glad to have
pitched their tents around the Bluegrass and remained
there forever, but dangers rose thick, fast, plenteous
on every side and the question of escape now began
to loom up as the greatest problem of the hour. As
if to defy fate and to show his enemies the extent to
which he could go, General Morgan determined to
capture Cynthiana, thirty-two miles north from Lexington
and twice that distance from Cincinnati.
When he should once reach Cynthiana, if the game
became too strong for him to return along the direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
through which he had come, he might go around by
Pound Gap, or up along the Big Sandy and reach
Virginia, and then march down to the place from whence
he had started. Several hundred men under Colonel
Landram of the 7th Kentucky cavalry and a number
of Home Guards were defending Cynthiana. The
Confederate commander was anxious to give the
Federals once more a touch of his skillful and avenging
hand and let them feel once again the impress of his
power and he rapidly marched to Cynthiana. The
guards of the town had a twelve pound brass howitzer.
This had been sent out from Cincinnati in charge of a
company of firemen. Morgan thoroughly understood
the topography of Cynthiana. The Federal pickets
were attacked a mile and a half from the town and an
advance guard chased them to the edge of the city.</p>

<p>To get into Cynthiana, troops would have to cross
the Licking River. An old-time, narrow, covered
wooden bridge led over the stream, but by its side
there was a ford waist-deep. Above and below, one
mile each way, there were fords. Gano’s battalion
was sent up and the Georgian regiment down, with the
command to attack the town from the directions along
which they were ordered to move. The 2nd Kentucky,
deemed the steadiest of those with Morgan, was to
enter the town by the Georgetown road. The Federals
had, with great skill, placed their men on the opposite
bank of the river, and no sooner had the regiment
come in sight than they opened a brisk fire. One thousand
feet from the bridge the little Confederate howitzers
were placed and they opened their fire upon the
houses which had been occupied by the enemy. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
Federals’ one piece of artillery had been fixed to sweep
the bridge. Two companies marching up the banks
of the river opened such fierce fire across the stream
that the Federal troops at that point were glad to
throw down their guns, and it was one of the curious
episodes of war that their captors made them wade
across the river to complete surrender. As the space
through the bridge was in the line of the Federal guns
and the approach protected by sharpshooters, it became
apparent that to proceed in that direction would
entail a large loss, so without further ado Company A
of the 2nd Kentucky, raising their guns and ammunition
above their heads, waded the stream and established
themselves behind houses on the opposite side
and poured in heavy volleys upon the Federal column.
The “bull pups” were brought forward, but as the lines
were then not more than one hundred and twenty-five
feet apart, the fire from the sharpshooters was so
fierce that it drove the gunners from the pieces. The
bullets of the Federals, striking the horses, attached
to one of the limbers, they ran away carrying it within
the Federal lines. A game so tense could not last long,
and Company C, of which Captain James W. Bowles,
ever valiant—and at that moment thought reckless—was
in command, charged across the bridge and up
the main street. However reckless the movement, it
turned the scale for the Confederates.</p>

<p>In a few moments the Federals were driven from
their positions and forced back to the center of the
town. The Texans under Gano and the Georgians
under their lieutenant colonel now began to make themselves
felt, and all three assailing parties met at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
same moment around the piece of artillery which the
enemy had fired with such rapidity and with great
effect, and all three claimed the honor of its taking.
The stream was passed, the Federals routed. The
attack upon the depot in which the Federals had taken
refuge was effective, and Colonel Landram, who was
commander of the garrison, was chased ten miles on
the Paris road.</p>

<p>Before the victory was won the new recruits,
picking up guns which had been thrown down by the
Federals, inspired by the courage of the veterans,
rapidly rushed to the front and received their baptism
of fire. Company A, which with such gallantry had
waded the river to get at the enemy’s head, suffered
great loss. The captain, first lieutenant and second
lieutenant had been wounded and the command of
the company fell to the third lieutenant.</p>

<p>The day was filled with stirring incidents. The
march of twenty-two miles from Georgetown had been
made to Cynthiana, and the first act had been closed
by its capture before noon. Morgan had wounded and
killed one hundred of his enemy; he had lost forty,
killed and wounded, and had captured four hundred
prisoners. With sorrow and grief he left a portion
of the severely wounded behind, and the dead were
abandoned and remained in the hands of kind and
sympathizing friends, to be laid away in the cemetery
on the hill.</p>

<p>If it had been difficult to get so far into Kentucky,
the danger of getting out was hourly increasing. By
two o’clock the march was begun for Paris, and Morgan
turned his face Dixie-ward. It was fourteen miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
from Cynthiana to Paris. A long way out from Paris,
a deputation from the town met General Morgan,
offering to surrender the place. As the sun went down,
the command went into camp a short distance east of
Paris. The day had been a vigorous one. Twenty-two
miles to Cynthiana, a fight, captures, destruction of
property, fourteen miles to Paris, was not a bad day’s
work, and in the beautiful Bluegrass woods, with an
abundance of food for man and beast, the hours of
the night were passed. The bold riders had earned
sleep and no fears of the morrow disturbed their tranquility.
They had learned to let each day’s trouble
care for itself. If they were not sleeping the sleep of
the just, they were enjoying the repose of the worn
and weary.</p>

<p>Early in the morning a large Federal cavalry force,
estimated at three thousand, commanded by General
Green Clay Smith, drove in Morgan’s pickets. These
were not very hungry for Confederate work, and they
did not push the fighting. The prisoners had been
paroled, but a long line of buggies and carriages were
sandwiched in between the commands composing
Morgan’s following, bearing away the wounded who
had met their fate at Glasgow, Cynthiana and other
points along the line. There was a sort of brotherhood
oath among Morgan’s men that the wounded would
never be left, and it was only under extreme circumstances
that this obligation was voided. The failure
to find the usual number of wounded after a battle
encouraged the belief that Morgan had taken the lives
of his wounded to prevent their being made prisoners.
If the Confederates could keep the Federals behind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
there was not much danger. Morgan’s force had been
camped on the Winchester road, and this was the way
he intended to take on his march southward.</p>

<p>Well out on the Winchester Pike, Morgan waited
for General Smith’s force, two and a half times as numerous
as his own. The Confederate commander had
no fear of those who should follow. He doubted not
that he could outride any pursuers. His chief concern
was about those who should get in front, not those
who might come from the rear. From Paris to Winchester
was sixteen miles, and though he was occasionally
attacked by General Smith, he proceeded leisurely
along the macadam highway between the two places,
and rested his men at Winchester from twelve to four
o’clock in the afternoon. A twelve hour march, including
the night, brought Morgan to Richmond.
He here found awaiting him a complete company of
new recruits under Captain Jennings. Half a day’s
rest at Richmond and another night march brought
the Confederates to Crab Orchard.</p>

<p>Morgan had intended to remain for some time at
Richmond and recruit as large a number of new soldiers
as possible, but Smith was behind him, other detachments
were converging toward his path, and the
Federal colonel, Frank Woodford, was collecting forces
to intercept his march southward and troops were
being rushed by rail to Lebanon. Notwithstanding
all this, General Morgan exhibited neither fear nor
haste. He preserved the dignities of a complacent
withdrawal from scenes, though full of danger, not yet
so imminent as to make him rush away as if not willing,
if necessary, to try out the wage of battle. A few hours’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
rest at Crab Orchard and at eleven o’clock the march
was commenced to Somerset, about twenty-eight
miles distant. By sundown the space had been covered.
Here the Confederates again found large quantities
of stores, the telegraph office was open. More
than a hundred wagons were captured and burned, and
ammunition, shoes, blankets and hats, in great quantities,
were stored in warehouses in exceeding abundance.
There was lavish appropriation. A few wagons were
loaded with the things which were most needed in
Dixie, and the torch was applied to the others and they
were reduced to ashes.</p>

<p>At Stigall’s Ferry, six miles from Somerset, the
Cumberland River was passed, and that night the
command camped at Monticello, twenty-two miles
southwardly. All need of hurry was now past. There
was no likelihood that the Federals would cross the
Cumberland River. Morgan had outmarched them
and out-maneuvered them and he was safe. With
satisfaction and peace of mind born of noble achievement,
he could look back upon the events of the past
twenty-four days. He summed it up in these words:
“I left Knoxville on the 4th of this month with nine
hundred men and returned to Livingston on the 28th
inst. with twelve hundred, having been absent twenty-four
days, during which time I have traveled over a
thousand miles, captured seventeen towns, destroyed
all the government supplies and arms in them, dispersed
about fifteen hundred Home Guards, paroled
nearly twelve hundred regular troops. I lost in killed
and wounded and missing of the number that I carried
into Kentucky, about ninety.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>At Somerset, Ellsworth, the operator, had telegraphed
for Morgan and himself several messages to
the Federal leaders in Kentucky, and concluded his
telegraphic work with the following despatch: “Headquarters
Telegraphic Department of Kentucky, Confederate
States of America. General Order Number 1.
When an operator is positively informed that the enemy
is marching on his station, he will immediately proceed
to destroy the telegraphic instruments and all material
in his charge. Such instances of carelessness as were
exhibited on the part of the operators at Lebanon and
Midway and Georgetown will be severely dealt with.—By
order of G. A. Ellsworth, General Military
Superintendent, C. S. Telegraphic Department.”</p>

<p>The story of the successes, victories and strategies
of this wonderful expedition was quickly spread abroad
throughout the entire Confederate States. The minds
of many of the young men were stirred by the strange
exploits of Morgan on this raid, and their hearts were
thrilled with the story of his adventures and his triumphs.
Many who had not enlisted were inclined to
seek service under the Kentucky chieftain. They
longed to have experiences such as he and his followers
had enjoyed on this marvellous raid. What was
accomplished by General Morgan set other Confederate
cavalry leaders to thinking and inspired them with
patriotic ambitions to emulate the tactics of the
Kentucky cavalryman.</p>

FORREST’S RAID INTO WEST TENNESSEE,<br>
DECEMBER, 1862</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">To the great Volunteer State, Tennessee, belongs
the credit of having produced, in many respects,
the most remarkable cavalry leader in the world—Nathan
Bedford Forrest. He was born near Duck
River, at a little hamlet called Chapel Hill, then in
Bedford County, Tennessee, but now comprised within
the boundaries of Marshall County. Scotch-Irish and
English blood flowed through the veins of this great
warrior. This strain rarely fails to produce courage,
fortitude and enterprise.</p>

<p>When Nathan Bedford Forrest was thirteen years
of age, the financial affairs of his father, William Forrest,
had gone awry. Leaving Tennessee with seven
children, he entered a homestead in Tippah County,
North Mississippi, a region which had just been opened
to settlement through a purchase by the Federal
Government from the Chickasaw Indians. The magical
hand of immigration had as yet done little for this
region. The Indians had hunted over the lands, but
civilization had not given it prosperity and fitted it for
the homes of peaceful agriculturists.</p>

<p>Death, with rude hand and pitiless dart, cut down
the father, William Forrest. His oldest boy, not sixteen
years of age, became the head of his family, including
his mother, six brothers and three sisters, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
four months after the father had passed away, there
came a posthumous boy, Jeffrey, who, on the 22nd day
of February, 1864, was to die a soldier’s death at
Okolona, Mississippi, resisting Sooy Smith’s raid. In
the supreme moment of dissolution his valiant and
heroic brother pressed his dying form to his heart and
imprinted upon his cheek, now damp with the death
sweat, a last kiss of affection and love. The death of
this young brother, upon whom Forrest lavished an
immeasurable wealth of tenderness, was the greatest
blow the war brought to his fearless heart.</p>

<p>Forrest, deprived of education by the calls of filial
duty, secured only such learning as could be obtained
at a primary school in Middle Tennessee and in Mississippi
in 1836 and 1837, which was scant enough, and
which was won between the fall harvest and spring
planting seasons.</p>

<p>Within three years, by his indomitable will, his
great industry, his shrewd judgment and unceasing
labor, he had won for his mother, sisters and brothers
agricultural independence.</p>

<p>Typhoid fever, with malignant fierceness, had
stricken down two of his brothers and his three sisters,
one of these last being a twin sister of Forrest himself.</p>

<p>When twenty years of age, the war spirit of Forrest
was moved by the struggles of the people of Texas in
their contest with Mexico for independence, and among
the adventurous and gallant boys of the South, who
cast in their lot with the people of Texas, was this
young Tennessean. After reaching the scenes of war,
lack of transportation and of necessity for their services
forced these young men to either settle in the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
republic or to return to their homes. Forrest was
penniless, but he split enough rails in a little while to
pay his passage to his home in Mississippi, which he
reached after an absence of four and a half months.</p>

<p>In 1845 Forrest involuntarily became an actor in a
tragedy in Hernando. Four men, grieved at some act
of his partner and uncle, Jonathan Forrest, undertook
to kill him. Single-handed and alone, Nathan Bedford
Forrest severely wounded three of the assailants and
drove the fourth from the field. In the conflict, the
uncle was mortally wounded, although he had taken no
part in the affray.</p>

<p>After reverses in business, Forrest left Hernando,
in 1852, and established himself as a broker in real
estate and dealer in slaves in Memphis.</p>

<p>In 1861, General Forrest was a cotton planter in
Coahoma County, Mississippi, growing a thousand
bales of cotton per annum, and with his fortune increasing
every year.</p>

<p>He now stood high among the most successful and
active business men in Memphis. He had won a fortune
by sagacity, integrity and sobriety, and though
lacking in education, there was something in his personnel
that impressed men with his right to be a leader.
He was a born captain, and nature wrote his right to
command on his face.</p>

<p>In April, 1861, his foresight assured him that war
was inevitable, and he proceeded to arrange his affairs
for the impending conflict. His whole soul was centered
in his desire to make the South free, and the
independence of the Confederate states, he firmly
believed, was the only guarantee for a permanent peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>After a visit to Mississippi, he returned to Memphis
and immediately became a private in the Tennessee
Mounted Rifles, under Captain Josiah H. White. He
sought no rank. His highest aim was to serve his country,
and, resolved upon the utmost effort to uphold her
cause, he was willing to face all dangers where duty
pointed the way. The pupil soon taught the master,
and within a month Isham G. Harris, Governor of
Tennessee, and General Leonidas Polk urged and commissioned
Forrest to recruit a regiment of cavalry. A
hurried visit to Kentucky enabled him to purchase five
hundred Colt’s navy pistols and a hundred saddles
with their equipments.</p>

<p>While in Louisville, he learned that a company of
cavalry was being organized for him by Captain Frank
Overton, at Brandenburg, Meade County. Hastening
thither, he mustered in the Boone Rangers, ninety
stalwart sons of Kentucky, which became the first
company of the regiment.</p>

<p>Forrest was not long in reaching Bowling Green
with his Boone Rangers. A skirmish or two on the way
demonstrated his marvelous genius for war, inspired his
men with absolute faith in his leadership, and left behind
him an ominous warning to those who later in
the struggle should be so unfortunate as to cross his
path.</p>

<p>A company was organized in Memphis during
Forrest’s absence, called the Forrest Rangers, under
Captain Charles May,—and the Boone Rangers
became the nucleus of Forrest’s famous regiment,
which in a few weeks grew to be a battalion of eight
companies, and, which in a few days by active operations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
laid the foundations of their leader’s astonishing
reputation and success.</p>

<p>Two of Forrest’s companies were from Kentucky,
one from Meade County and one from Harrodsburg.
Alabama contributed four, Texas one, and Memphis
one, so that as far as his fame was to become coextensive
with the South and West it would seem as if
fate had spread over Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama
and Texas a call for these men who were to make their
commander renowned.</p>

<p>In a little while, Alabama sent two more companies,
and the regiment became of sufficient numbers to
make Forrest lieutenant colonel. Alabama troops
predominated in his own regiment.</p>

<p>Many skirmishes and marches marked the career
of this active and aggressive command prior to February,
1862, and then Forrest was ordered to repair to
Fort Donelson, where as senior officer, he assumed
command of the cavalry of the army here concentrated.
The cavalry consisted of Forrest’s regiment, Colonel
Gantt’s Tennessee Battalion, and three Kentucky
companies under Captains Huey, Wilcox and Williams,
counting, all told, eight hundred men.</p>

<p>Twenty-five thousand Federals surrounded fourteen
thousand Confederates at the eventful siege of
Fort Donelson. By the exigencies of war these men
were surrendered. Whose fault brought about this
unfortunate result has long been one of the most
fiercely discussed of Confederate military problems.</p>

<p>When a council of war had decreed that a surrender
was inevitable, Forrest entered an earnest protest;
and at the suggestion of General Pillow, he was allowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
to effect his escape, upon condition that he should do so
before a flag of truce had communicated with the enemy.
The sequel shows upon what slight events human
destiny hinges. Had Forrest been less courageous or
determined, his future would have been entirely changed.
His pluck and his pride revolted at a cavalry soldier
yielding without a vehement wrestle with the god
of chance; and his brave soul cried out against becoming
prisoner without one impetuous appeal to fate for a
juster determination of the conflict which raged at this
crucial hour.</p>

<p>In the darkness and frost of a cold winter night,
Forrest immediately laid his plans to bring his horsemen
out of the beleaguered fort. By four o’clock in the
morning, with five hundred men and officers, he undertook
to ride away. He could only conjecture as to what
was ahead. He had no time to send out scouts to reconnoitre
as to the presence or position of his foes.
He was not so much concerned as to who and where
they were. The only anxious inquiry that crossed his
mind was how many they were and whether the waters
that traversed his path were too deep or too swift for
him and his followers to ford or swim in their struggle to
find a way of escape from the clutches of their enemies.
He had no guides to point the road. He knew that
safety beckoned for a southward march. A great host
was encamped somewhere in the vicinity. He knew
they were ready to dispute his going. He had never
traveled the road he was to follow. His keen vision
could only pierce a few feet into the blackness of the
night. He had only one plan and that was to fight and
ride over whatever obstructed his chosen track. With<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
one hand to guide his steed and the other grimly gripping
his faithful revolver, he led his followers cautiously
and yet speedily amidst the oppressive silence. Every
slip of his floundering steeds amidst the gloom of the
cold and dreary night, seemed full of awful portent and
danger, and yet, amidst all these depressing conditions,
the gallant leader entertained no thought of a retreat
and sternly ordered all to go forward. It required an
iron will and an invincible soul to thus lead five hundred
men on this desperate and difficult ride. A few
wounded Federal soldiers, crouching by the fires of the
rails they had kindled into flames to keep the warmth
of life in their maimed bodies until their comrades
with the dawn of day should bring succor, were the
only sentinels that called to the riders to halt. These
were not disposed to question Forrest’s right to pass
on into the outlying darkness and he was glad to leave
them alone in the cheerless hours of that dread night,
which the misfortunes of war had forced them to face.</p>

<p>Once, back water seemed to stop the course of the
gallant troopers, but it was only for a moment. His
advance guard hesitated, but calling them to clear the
way, he fearlessly crushed the ice with his sword, and
bade those behind to follow where he so promptly and
confidently led.</p>

</figure>

<p>This sally and escape of Forrest, in the face of almost
insurmountable obstacles, gave him a reputation
for courage and enterprise that betokened how great
his future would be. That this determined cavalryman
marched safely away, was to the ambitious and
glory-seeking youth of the Southwest a special invitation
to enlist under his banners; and decided many of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>the bravest and most patriotic men of middle Tennessee
to enlist under the guidons of such fame-winners
as Forrest, Wheeler and Morgan. Succeeding events
would only magnify his promise and his skill. Forrest
had already shown himself in the briefest while to be
a great cavalry leader, and his genius, to those who
watched and interpreted it ever so slightly, shone with
transcendent brilliance and indicated that he would
win renown and attain the highest rank.</p>

<p>On the 16th of March, 1862, two other Tennessee
companies came to the regiment; these gave it a full
roster, and by acclamation he became colonel; Kelly,
lieutenant colonel; and a private, R. M. Balch, major.</p>

<p>When General Bragg marched into Kentucky in
the summer of 1862, he left Nashville behind him,
under the control of the Federals. After returning
from Kentucky, in October, through Cumberland Gap,
by degrees he marched westward, and in early winter
at Murfreesboro, thirty miles south of Nashville,
established his lines.</p>

<p>General Bragg, in December, deemed it important
for General Forrest to make a raid into West Tennessee,
destroy connections with Memphis, apparently
threaten the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad between
Louisville and Nashville, damage the railroads and
break up, if possible, the lines of transportation which
enabled the Federals to maintain themselves at Memphis
and the adjacent territory.</p>

<p>General Wheeler had been promoted and assigned
to the chief command of the cavalry, with headquarters
at La Vergne, and Forrest was ordered to report to
General Bragg in person. Thereupon, General Forrest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
was assigned to the command of a brigade of about
eighteen hundred men, consisting of the 4th, 8th and
9th Tennessee Regiments, Russell’s 4th Alabama and
Freeman’s Battery. This promotion of General Wheeler
over Forrest and Morgan greatly disappointed both of
these leaders and excited much criticism amongst the
rank and file. Not only with the cavalry, but with
infantry, was this action most severely condemned.
At this time General Wheeler had won neither the record
nor the fame which later excited the admiration of all
the men in the armies of the South. Morgan’s two
Kentucky raids and the Battle of Hartsville, one of
the most brilliant achievements of the war; Forrest’s
escape from Donelson, his magnificent service at Shiloh,
and his assault on Nashville and capture of Murfreesboro,
had already made both marked men and given
them the admiration and love of the entire army, and
there was much indignation at the apparent subordination
of Forrest and withdrawal from his forces of the
men who had been taught in his campaigns his methods
of fighting, and who had learned to believe in him as
one of the most wonderful soldiers of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>General Bragg received, with some degree of impatience,
General Forrest’s complaints as to either
insufficient equipment or undisciplined troops, and
directed General Forrest to march westward, to cross
the Tennessee River, and operate north and west of
Memphis, up to the Kentucky line as far as Moscow,
some hundred and sixty miles away.</p>

<p>Taking his final orders on the 10th of December,
1862, and reviewing his command, at the risk of being
reprimanded for insubordination, in writing he again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
called the attention of General Bragg to the lack of
ammunition and supplies, and proper arms for his men.</p>

<p>The soldiers under him were largely raw new levies,
armed chiefly with flintlock rifles, many without flints.
They possessed ten caps per man, and a very meagre
and scanty supply of ammunition.</p>

<p>In response to his second demand for better guns
and more ammunition, he was curtly and peremptorily
ordered to march without delay and take his chances
with what had been assigned him for the raid.</p>

<p>Forrest keenly felt this treatment. His best troops
had been taken from him. Only four old companies
remained with him, men who had already shown great
aptitude for partisan work and knew his method of
fighting, and were prepared to follow him under all
conditions.</p>

<p>To the untrained student General Bragg’s orders
bordered on cruelty, and Forrest fiercely resented in
his heart the great wrong thus inflicted upon him. He
was proud, brave and profoundly patriotic, and no man
in the South was more deeply attached to the Southern
cause than he. For awhile he brooded over this injustice,
but he loved his country too much to falter or
hesitate even if he felt and believed that this treatment
was indefensible. General Bragg, to him it appeared,
had sent him upon the most dangerous mission of the
war, and as if to render the task doubly hazardous, had
taken from him the men he so much needed for the
work he was required to do, and had given him instead
men whose inexperience and lack of drill and discipline
would render his success full of uncertainty and well-nigh
impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>He was commanded to undertake and possibly to
force the passage of the Tennessee River, when it was
swollen by the winter rains, and without even the semblance
of a pontoon bridge, he was expected to cross
his men, horses, artillery and supplies as best he could.
He was either to construct ferry boats, or raise those
that had been sunken to hide them from Federal eyes;
to search in the creeks or thickets for a few skiffs, or to
fashion them from the boards he might pick up in a
country already impoverished by the ravages of war.
He was to cross the river in face of a vigilant and expectant
foe whose garrisons were ordered to be upon
the alert for his coming; and were a long time before
urged to watch for the presence of the man whose fear
was in every heart and whose desperate courage and
resistless onslaught had made him a very terror to the
peace and quiet of those who were to prevent his coming,
or expected to punish his appearance in the country,
the holding of which was an essential to the safety
of their operations on the Mississippi River below
Memphis. Thereafter, he was to move into a region
filled with large Federal garrisons, all thoroughly
armed, very many times more numerous than his own
force, and to ride over roads softened by the winter
rains, which by the travel of his horses and guns, were
churned into slush, reaching above the knees of the
animals, and through which his artillery could only be
drawn at an average speed of less than a walk. The
conditions of these highways would not only disspirit
his followers, but subject them to such physical
strain as would possibly render them unable to perform
the duties that the campaign necessitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>He had eighteen hundred troops and four guns.
Baggage was reduced to a minimum. Marching westward
from Columbia, Tennessee, he reached a place
called Clifton, on the Tennessee River. An old, leaky
ferryboat, “a tub,” raised from the bottom of the
stream where it had been sunk to save it from Federal
destruction; a hastily constructed similar craft made
from hewed logs, and a half dozen skiffs, were his only
means of transportation across the deep stream. The
boats were either rotten or leaky, and all dangerous.
Horses and mules were driven into the stream and
forced to swim, while the men with their saddles,
blankets, frying pans, guns, cannon caissons and ammunition
wagons, were with the constant fear of
Federal gunboats, Federal cavalry and infantry ever
in their minds and with constant apprehension of
resistance, as speedily as possible, under these adverse
conditions, ferried to the western bank of the swollen
river.</p>

<p>Only a great soldier and a great leader could have
maintained his own equanimity with such adverse
surroundings, or could have kept his followers under
control with destruction every moment staring them
in the face. On the shore, now on the western bank,
now in the turgid waters, again on the eastern side, he
calmly directed every movement, and his presence gave
his followers hope when hope seemed absurd, and imbued
them with a sublime courage they themselves
could not fathom or understand. That he was there
quieted every impulse to fear, and that his eye was upon
them spurred every man to the noblest endeavors.
Before him, every thought of cowardice became a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
retreating fugitive, and his example taught every
trooper in the brigade that no foe was invincible and
no task impossible. Morgan and his men crossing the
Cumberland to reach Hartsville, Wheeler and his men
forcing a passage of the Tennessee to destroy Rosecrans’
trains, were full of sublime heroism, but Forrest’s
passage of the Tennessee River at Clifton, on
December 16th and 17th, 1862, will long live as one
of the most persistently courageous achievements of
cavalry in any age or war.</p>

<p>The strain on man and beast was almost unbearable.
Forrest had with him many officers as brave as he but
less experienced; but Starnes, Dibrell, Russell, Jeffrey
Forrest, Freeman, Morton, Biffle, Woodward, William
M. Forrest, Cox, Gurley and many others in this
command held up the hands of their beloved leader
and aided him in giving even the humblest private a
spirit of devotion that made every man who wore the
gray jacket an intrepid hero, and a soldier who was
without fear, even unto death.</p>

<p>Scouts above and below, ever vigilant, watched for
coming gunboats. Pickets, hastily sent out on the
western side of the stream, guarded every road that
led to the ferry, and eager eyes, quickened by impending
danger, scanned every hilltop and watched every
avenue of approach. Two nights and a day were
consumed in this arduous undertaking. The gunboats
could not safely travel at night and Forrest availed
himself of this to further his difficult work. He was
crossing, with most inadequate means, the fifth largest
stream in the United States. The distance from shore
to shore was more than half a mile, the current was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
rapid, and while poling flatboats is a slow and tedious
process by day, by night the difficulties were much
enhanced. Forrest and his men successfully defied and
overcame these natural obstacles, and by the morning
of the 17th his men and equipments were all over, the
boats were poled back to the western shore, sunk, committed
to the care of a few guards, who protested at
being left behind for what they esteemed an inglorious
task, and with a questioning gaze, Forrest looked
across the stream, wondering if he could later repass
its currents, and with a wave of his sword, launched
forth on his hazardous mission. Aligning his small
command, he bade them go forward, not doubting
that even with such odds against him, fate would
lend a helping hand and safely bring him back from
sure yet unknown dangers and fierce battles to his own,
again.</p>

<p>This tremendous task accomplished and his scattered
forces united, he marched eight miles to Lexington,
Henderson County, and encamped for a little
while, to allow his wet, hungry and tired soldiers to dry
their clothes, inspect their guns, and to relieve their
minds as well as their bodies of the great strain to
which they had been subjected in the extraordinary
and eventful experiences of the past forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>On examination, it was found that the greater part
of the ammunition, in crossing the Tennessee River,
had become wet and consequently unserviceable, and
while this loss of the slight supply of ammunition
which had been assigned to his command was being
considered, a blockade-runner who had been sent
through the lines, appeared with fifty thousand caps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>Forrest had sent forward his agents to secure this
supply of ammunition. Already the Federals had had
warning of Forrest’s coming, and he had barely advanced
a mile until he had encountered squadrons of
the Federal force moving along the same road to check
his farther advance. Prepared or unprepared, Forrest
had come to fight. He viciously assailed the Federals
and quickly captured or routed one, a Federal Tennessee
regiment, and the other the 11th Regiment of
Illinois Volunteers, in which last Robert G. Ingersoll
became a Confederate prisoner.</p>

<p>Refreshed and strengthened by Federal supplies,
and new and better mounts, he pursued the fugitives
furiously, and three days after crossing the river
reached Jackson, Tennessee (fifty miles away). He
had rested only a day, and his march was never without
opposition from his foe.</p>

<p>The Federals quickly concentrated troops at Jackson
from the North and South. The railroads from the
north were immediately torn up, isolated stations were
captured, and guns and ammunition provided for
thoroughly arming the Confederates. Forrest was not
slow and by the removal and bending of the rails, he
cut off further succor or supplies to the garrison at
Jackson from the north.</p>

<p>At this time, the force at Jackson was estimated at
fifteen thousand. Maneuvering so as to create the
impression of an army of a larger force than was really
at his call, and with only one regiment apparently in
front of Jackson, he started northwest to Humboldt,
and here found his richest booty. Two hundred prisoners,
four gun caissons, five hundred standard muskets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
and three hundred thousand rounds of ammunition, and
equipments of all sorts here fell into Forrest’s hands.</p>

<p>Reserving the best for himself, the torch was applied
to the remainder and the insatiable flames ate up the
property that Federal foresight had collected to feed
the garrisons that now filled every town of any importance
in the adjacent country. His force, had now become
steadied by the influence of his example and by
his brilliant success. The experiences of a few days
had made them veterans, and taught them the ways and
genius of their resourceful leader and he too now began
to realize that even these new and hitherto untried
men were dependable soldiers in any crisis that his
daring might invoke.</p>

<p>Five days out from the Tennessee River, General
Forrest reached Trenton, and prepared for its capture.
A man of intensive action, he quickly surrounded the
town. It did not take long to drive the enemy into
their breastworks. A charge from Forrest and his
escort completed the work. With two hundred and
seventy-five men, some of them inexperienced volunteers,
General Forrest had captured four hundred
prisoners of war, including two colonels, many field
officers, a thousand horses and mules, wagons and
ambulances, and ammunition, and two hundred thousand
rations of subsistence, all worth a half million of
dollars.</p>

<p>Flintlock muskets and shotguns were now thrown
away. Enfield rifles, the best possible Confederate arm
of that period, were issued to his entire command, and
with an equipment, the same in most respects as that
of their foes, the new soldiers caught the true spirit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
of war and were eager to meet their adversaries upon
more equal terms. Recruits had more than made up
for the losses which Forrest had suffered, and well-equipped
and well-armed, he still numbered eighteen
hundred men and officers.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Tennessee Federal Regiment,
all other prisoners were paroled, required to
march to Columbus, Kentucky, under an escort, and
there turned over to the Federal commander.</p>

<p>The way was now clear, and General Forrest
marched toward Union City, on the line between
Kentucky and Tennessee. Stockade after stockade
was taken, and the real and greatest work of the expedition
was now begun. He had come to destroy the
railroads. A few of his companies had done such work
before, and with eagerness and spirit they gleefully set
about the pleasing task. Spikes were drawn, rails were
stacked on piles of logs, and the fiery flames assisted
in the work of demolition. The iron rails, under the
influence of the savage glow, began to twirl and twist
and, bent in all directions by the increasing heat
furnished by renewed giant piles of wood, they seemed
almost alive in their strange contortions; and curved,
crooked and ill-shapen lengths of iron were soon all that
remained of the tracks that were so essential to transport
food supplies for the armies which encamped
toward the south, who were dependent upon these
rails for their daily bread. He followed the line of the
Mobile and Ohio railroad and destroyed it, and tore up
its track for fifteen miles, burning down trestles, removing
cattle guards, and inflicting tremendous losses
upon the line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the forces at Jackson had gotten
their second breath. They undertook now to intercept
Forrest and prevent his recrossing the Tennessee River.
Short work was made of Union City; two hundred and
fifty officers and men entrenched, surrendered with their
arms and supplies. Here three hundred more prisoners
were paroled.</p>

<p>General Forrest had now reached the northern
limit of the lines of his expedition, at Moscow, a few
miles over the Kentucky border. Several days were
spent in demolishing the heavy trestles on the north
and south forks of the Obion River.</p>

<p>Twelve thousand Federal soldiers had now been
concentrated at Trenton. Forrest had not been out
from his crossing of the Tennessee River nine days.
Marching twenty-six miles to Dresden, and realizing
the work that was before him, he resolved to give his
animals and his men a day’s rest to prepare them for
the well-nigh superhuman tasks which were before them.</p>

<p>The Federal commanders resolved to prevent General
Forrest from recrossing the Tennessee River, and
to this end, they applied all the means at their command.
They had plenty of men, but the trying problem
was to anticipate Forrest’s track and to cope
with his wonderful methods for outwitting his foes.</p>

<p>With the keen mind of the great cavalry soldier, it
did not take General Forrest long to understand that
his enemies were concentrating their forces to prevent
his re-passage of the river. He fully understood that it
was impossible for him to escape south, that he must go
east, and in going east, he must get over the Tennessee
River. Before he could start well upon his return,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
it was necessary for him to cross the Obion River,
which empties into the Tennessee, but this was now
full with winter floods. All the bridges but one had
been destroyed. Across this dangerous and uncertain
stream, the bridge had been partially torn out, and it
was left undefended because it was regarded as
impassable.</p>

<p>Within an hour, the men were at work getting
together timber with which to repair the bridge, so as
to admit of the passage of artillery. The seemingly
hopeless task was accomplished in the briefest period.
Within an hour, the causeway was made passable. It
was a cold, dark midnight, and a sleeting, drizzling
rain was falling, chilling the bones but not the hearts
of the Confederate command.</p>

<p>General Forrest, in order to nerve his soldiers for
the dangers of slipping from the tottering bridge,
himself mounted the saddle horse and drove over the
first wagon. Catching the inspiration of their great
leader’s courage, two teamsters attempted to follow.
They slipped or fell from the bridge and plunged into
the deep stream and freezing mud, from which they
were with difficulty released.</p>

<p>Men, who had hitherto looked on with undisturbed
hearts, now began to question if the crossing of the
stream could be made, whether in the gloom of the
dark hours which precede the dawn, and the dawn
was far off, it would be possible to carry over his sixteen
hundred soldiers now present with their equipments.
But there was no difficulty or danger that
could quail the heart of Nathan Bedford Forrest.
The muddy, slushy roads made the passage more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
dangerous. Conscious of the lack of supplies in the
territory into which he must return, Forrest was
endeavoring to carry a number of wagon loads of flour,
coffee and sugar. The safety of his command and the
lives of his soldiers rose higher than all thoughts of the
commissary, and the mud and chuck holes were filled
with sacks of flour and coffee, and along these and over
these the wagons passed.</p>

<p>The trains, by three o’clock, had been gotten over
the bridge, but the muddy, sloppy condition rendered
it impossible for the artillery horses to draw the guns
and caissons. The horses were knee deep in mud, and
the men waded in slush half way up their limbs. Fifty
men were detailed with ropes to pull each piece of
artillery, and only by these superhuman efforts, at three
o’clock in the morning, the Obion was passed.</p>

<p>The only rest that could be allowed after the awful
experiences of the night was a short halt for food;
and hardly had men and beasts satisfied nature’s
craving until the scouts informed General Forrest that
twelve miles away were several thousand men, converging
upon his small and valiant force.</p>

<p>General Forrest had no idea at this time of giving
any intimation where he would pass the Tennessee
River. And he pursued his way southward toward
Lexington, over a wild, rough, hilly, rocky road. The
tramp of the horses and the cutting of the wheels of
the artillery and the wagons made the road a veritable
bayou. The friable soil, stirred and cut by cannon,
caisson and wagon wheels, and mixed by the six thousand
hoofs of the cavalry horses, became a canal of
freezing slush. The animals and their equipments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
were bespattered with this horrible material, and the
clothing, necks, faces, saddles, blankets and guns of
the riders were covered with mud, making the march
extremely distressing. With grim courage, they ceased
endeavoring to wipe the disgusting slime from their
faces or clothing. They gritted their teeth, clenched
their reins with a stronger grip, and, uncomplaining,
rode on in the dark stillness of the awful night; they
could at least, they believed, endure the horrors of the
situation until dawn of day. This, they hoped, would
bring some relief and somewhat assuage the dreadful
punishment of this night march. The scouts reported
one brigade of the enemy within six miles of General
Forrest, another, six miles from this force. Resting
until four o’clock, his men were aroused, ordered to
saddle and prepare for the advance upon the Federal
armies.</p>

<p>General Forrest determined to force the fighting,
and he had only a brief time to form a line of battle.
Biffle, with his regiment, had moved towards Trenton,
but the soldierly instinct told him that his chieftain
was calling for him, and so he paroled his prisoners,
destroyed his supplies, and turned his face toward the
battlefield which was now to decide the fate of the
command. General Forrest believed he could destroy
one brigade, under Colonel Dunham, before the other,
under General Sullivan, could march six miles over
the terrible roads along which it must advance, and
he resolved to try his fortunes with Dunham first.</p>

<p>The Federals were quite as eager for conflict as
General Forrest, and as soon as they felt the impact,
pressed forward with great vigor. General Forrest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
had six pieces of artillery and about fourteen hundred
available fighting men; he was hunting a fight, and he
was to get quite all that he desired.</p>

<p>Both sides felt the importance of the issue, and both
were eager to secure the advantage in positions. Forrest’s
artillery, always well placed, was now concentrated
upon the Federal lines. The men in blue advanced
resolutely to within a hundred and eighty feet
of the artillery, but they only came to be repulsed with
great slaughter. The Confederate leader thought it was
better to make this first an artillery fight, and to reserve
his small arms for the later period, when the second
force should try issues with him.</p>

<p>Colonel Dunham, in command of the Federals,
showed himself to be a fighter. Repulses did not
weaken the courage of either himself or his troops, and
they renewed charge upon charge. At last his lines
were broken, and his men left their cover and ran
across the field, where many of them were captured
and slain.</p>

<p>Colonel Starnes attacked the enemy in the rear.
He had been detached for making this kind of assault;
always one of Forrest’s chief maneuvers, who often
declared that one man in the rear was worth two in the
front. On Starnes’ arrival in the field, white flags were
hoisted and Forrest and his troopers were masters of
the situation.</p>

<p>While Forrest was congratulating himself upon his
safety, Colonel Carroll, a staff officer, rose up to inform
him that a superior number of Federals had come into
action and were now in his rear. This was a great
surprise and an unlooked-for emergency. A full brigade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
of fresh troops, now behind him, pressed on with remarkable
vigor and spirit, and the attack was so sudden
and fierce that two hundred and fifty of Forrest’s men
were captured, four caissons and two brass cannons
were disabled in an attempt to withdraw from the field,
and these were abandoned, with a loss of a number of
troopers and some artillery.</p>

<p>The newcomers were quite as game as the men who
had withstood Forrest’s several assaults. They poured
a heavy fire into the Confederate line sustained by their
artillery and fiercely and furiously assailed the several
Confederate positions. It looked as if the wily Confederate
leader had been caught napping, and that
favoring fortune, which had so often and so propitiously
come to his rescue, was about to desert his standard
and give the victory to his enemies.</p>

<p>With only a hundred and twenty-five men, Forrest
made one of his characteristic dashes upon the artillery
of the enemy, which was being served in such efficient
manner as to inflict great loss. Fortunately the horses
attached to three of the pieces took fright and ran in
the direction of the Confederate lines, where they were
seized and driven away.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Colonel Starnes had attacked
Dunham’s rear and this halted him, and enabled
General Forrest to capture General Dunham’s wagon
train with all his supplies, and this was skillfully
carried from the field.</p>

<p>General Forrest had now all the fighting he wanted
for one day. He had put in nine hours. Twenty-five
officers and men had been killed, seventy-five wounded
and two hundred and fifty captured. Three caissons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
five wagons and mules and seventy-five thousand
rounds of ammunition had been left with his enemies.</p>

<p>The Federals had fared even worse than the Confederates.
A colonel and lieutenant colonel and one
hundred and fifty rank and file had been wounded;
fifty dead lay on the ground.</p>

<p>Forrest, with twelve hundred fighting men, had
whipped eighteen hundred and then finally stood off
a fresh brigade. It was not often that General Forrest
was taken unawares, and those who knew his marvelous
ability to get information wondered how General Sullivan
with a fresh brigade could approach his rear and
attack it without notice. Forrest, however, had not
forgotten to look after this end of the line. The directions
were misunderstood by the officer. He, hearing
the guns, deemed it necessary to make a detour in
order to reach Forrest. Had this officer promptly reported
the presence of Sullivan, Forrest would have
been able to destroy Dunham before the arrival of
fresh Federal forces, and then with his usual vehemence
turned upon the Federal reenforcements and chosen
his battlefield with his fresher foes. For once the Confederate
chieftain was glad to get out of reach of his
enemies. He felt that he had fully enough of conflict,
and his best thoughts and energies were engaged in
devising ways and means to extricate his command
from what even he, chief of military optimists, must
admit was a most difficult and dangerous situation.</p>

<p>The engagement at Parker’s Cross Roads, where the
commands of Dunham and Sullivan felt that they had
severely battered General Forrest, gave the Federals
some grounds for believing that even he was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
invincible, and encouraged them to seek another trial;
and they were, though with many precautions for safety,
anxious to again fight out the wager-of-battle.</p>

<p>Twelve miles away from the battlefield, Forrest
halted to feed his men and dress the wounds of his
patient followers. They had passed the highest physical
tests and had come forth victorious, but even Forrest’s
followers had limitations and reached a point where
nature revolted and peremptorily called a halt.</p>

<p>The Confederate chieftain now determined to recross
the Tennessee at Clifton, the same point at which
he had passed it fifteen days before. In his hazardous
position, this was the only hope of emerging in safety.
He had left his sunken boats to rescue him in a last
emergency. At no other point was there a substantial
chance to find even the crudest means of passing the
swollen stream, which, like a great spectre, stood out
on the horizon to haunt his dreams and to thwart his
escape.</p>

<p>The Federals were glad to leave Forrest alone, and
Forrest was glad to leave them alone. With all the
vigor and courage the Federals had shown in the pursuit
of the Confederates, their failure at the last moment
to pursue and attack him while crossing the river is
one of the strange and inexplicable delinquencies
which now and then appeared in the tactics of both
armies, during the four years of the struggle.</p>

<p>When close to the river, the scouts brought information
that ten thousand infantry and cavalry were
moving from the direction of Purdy and towards
Clifton, and this gave General Forrest new cause for
apprehension and solicitude.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp56" id="p187" style="max-width: 47.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p187.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">GENERAL NATHAN BEDFORD FORREST</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>
<p>A few miles from Clifton, across Forrest’s only path
leading to the river, he found a regiment of Federal
cavalry drawn up in battle line. There was no time for
maneuvering, and Dibbrell, always gallant, was ordered
to charge down the road across which the Federals
had been placed. Dibbrell, realizing the situation, was
quick to act, and furiously assaulted the line, cut the
Federals asunder, and then Starnes and Biffle, one on
the right and the other on the left, went after the detachments,
and in a brief space they were scattered
and driven from the field.</p>

<p>Strange to say, twenty men were killed on the Federal
side and fifty prisoners taken, and only one man
struck on the Confederate side. This was General
Forrest’s forage master, who was standing by his side,
and called his attention to some object. While speaking,
he was struck by a spent ball, which flattened on
his forehead without penetrating the skull, and the
officer fell stunned, but soon revived and only suffered
the inconvenience of a severe headache.</p>

<p>Every nerve was now strained to reach the river.
The sun was at its meridian when General Forrest rode
up and looked across the currents that swirled between
him and safety. The skiffs on the other side of the
Tennessee, and the flatboats which had been sunk
after the passage on the 15th, had been raised, under the
direction of Jeffrey Forrest, who, with the speed born of
the extremities of the hour, with a small following
had galloped forward to put in readiness the meagre
flotilla with which the retreating Confederates might
cross the river and find safety from their numerous and
aggressive foes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>When General Forrest arrived, the boats were ready
to move, the horses were detached from all the wagons
and artillery, driven into the river and made to swim
across. The same process was gone through with the
cavalry horses. It was a wonderful sight to a looker-on,—hundreds
of horses struggling in a swollen stream.
All understood what even an hour’s delay might mean.
The beasts could swim, but no man could endure the
freezing waters, or hope after half a mile of immersion
under its chilling currents to emerge on the other side
alive. Logs were searched for in the drift, fence rails
were hunted. These were lashed together with grape
vines, halter ropes or bridle reins, and on these improvised
rafts, bushes and drift were piled, and with
poles or board paddles, pushed and pulled across the
stream.</p>

<p>The artillery and wagon horses and a majority of
the cavalry mounts were animals which had been
captured from the Federals. The supreme hour was at
hand. Only the speediest action could hold out the
slightest hope of escape. One section of artillery,
under Captain Douglass, and one regiment were
posted a mile away from the ferry. These were directed
to fortify their position as best they could, to
hold it in the face of all odds, under all circumstances,
and to fight even to annihilation. Only brave men,
who have received such a command, can realize how
calmly human courage rises to its very zenith under
such conditions. No one detailed for this important
duty sought relief. Forrest himself told them they must
stay and if need be, die to save their comrades. They
made no excuses, they asked no exemption. They were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
ready to serve as told and, had the occasion required,
every man was ready to fall where his country, at that
hour, called him to stand.</p>

<p>The river was eighteen hundred feet wide, but it
had banks which were favorable for the escape of the
animals from the stream.</p>

<p>From twelve o’clock until eight o’clock at night,
the flatboats pulled up stream half a mile and were
then permitted to drop down with the current, and were
drifted and poled across, and after eight hours the five
pieces of artillery, six caissons, sixty wagons and four
ambulances, equipments of all kinds, and the whole
command had been carried over the swollen stream
and were landed on the eastern side of the river.
Thirty-six hours out from Parker’s Cross Roads, where
Dunham and Sullivan and Fuller had raised such a
rough-house with Forrest, he had marched forty miles,
and safely passed all his forces with their horses and
trains over the Tennessee. This remarkable feat
again demonstrated Forrest’s wonderful wealth of
resource, and served notice on his enemies that there
was nothing he would not dare and few feats that he
could not accomplish.</p>

<p>Fourteen days had elapsed since the passage of the
river, but what marvelous experiences had Forrest and
his raw levies passed. They had traveled over three
hundred miles, had been in three sternly contested
engagements, with daily skirmishing, had destroyed
fifty large and small bridges on the Mobile and Ohio
Railroad, and had burned trestles, so as to make it
useless to the enemy; had captured twenty stockades,
captured and killed twenty-five hundred of the enemy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
taken and disabled ten pieces of artillery, carried off
fifty wagons and ambulances with their teams, had
captured ten thousand stands of excellent small arms
and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition,
had returned fully armed, equipped and mounted;
had traversed roads with army trains which at that
season were considered impassable, even by horsemen.
Only one night’s rest in fourteen days had been enjoyed,
unsheltered, without tents, and in a most inclement
winter, constantly raining, snowing and sleeting;
but these wonderful men had endured all these
hardships, neither murmuring, complaining nor doubting,
but always cheerful, brave and resigned to do any
and every duty that sternest war could bring.</p>

<p>This one campaign had made Forrest’s new troopers
veterans. There was now no service for which they
were not prepared. They were ready to follow their
leader at any time and everywhere, and thereafter
no troops would perform more prodigies of valor or
face a foe with more confidence or cheerfulness; and
yet before them were many of war’s sacrifices, dangers,
disasters, toils and trials, which would call for the best
that was in man.</p>

TEXAS HORSEMEN OF THE SEA,<br>
IN GALVESTON HARBOR, JANUARY, 1863</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">General John Bankhead Magruder
was born in Winchester, Virginia, on the 15th of
August, 1810. He came of not only a distinguished
but a martial family. Singularly attractive
in personality, he entered West Point and graduated
from that institution in 1830.</p>

<p>Thirty-six years of age when the Mexican War
began, he was not without a wide military experience,
and on many battlefields had exhibited the superb
courage which marked his entire career as a Confederate
officer. He won fame at Palo Alto in the Mexican
War, he earned a brevet at Cerro Gordo, and at Chapultepec
and in the City of Mexico he added still more
largely to his splendid reputation for gallantry and dash.
Imbued with all the patriotic state pride and love of a
native born Virginian, he early resigned his position
in the United States army and took service under the
Confederate government.</p>

<p>By March 16, 1861, he was colonel; ninety days
later a brigadier general; less than four months afterward
he was a major general; and, with probably one
exception, when it was claimed he was tardy, he justified
the opinion of his friends and superiors that he
was a great soldier, an eminent strategist, with extraordinary
aptitude for all phases and departments of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>In the Virginia-Yorktown campaign in 1861, he
fought the Battle of Big Bethel. He was then only a
colonel, but there he ranked such men as D. H. Hill
and others of great future renown.</p>

<p>Big Bethel was not much of a battle after all, but
it served to stimulate and nourish Southern pride, and
helped also to arouse Northern patriotism. With one
man killed and seven wounded, it is with reluctance
that it can be called a battle at all. The most that
General Magruder could enumerate as a loss on
the Federal side (with all the bias of a general anxious
to promote hope in his countrymen), was from
twenty-five to thirty killed and a hundred and fifty
wounded.</p>

<p>On this field fell the first martyr to the Southern
cause. He was a member of the 1st North Carolina
Infantry, and volunteered with four others to cross the
firing line and burn a house, from which it was supposed
the Federals would have superior advantages in
their assault on the Confederate position. When he
fell, his companions were recalled.</p>

<p>North Carolina, with the noble impulses of a great
state, and with commendable pride in its magnificent
reputation in the Confederate War; has builded a
monument to the first, not only of her sons, but all the
South’s sons, who laid down their lives for the life of the
Confederacy.</p>

<p>This young man was Henry L. Wyatt, only a private
in the 1st North Carolina Regiment, yet he won imperishable
fame by his service, which, while not more
glorious than the thousands of others who later made
the great sacrifice for their country, became preeminent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
because he was the first to shed out his blood
for the Southland.</p>

<p>From this battle, so ably directed by General
Magruder, comes North Carolina’s claim, “First at
Bethel.”</p>

<p>Not only in the United States army, but in the
Confederate army, General Magruder was known as
“Prince John.” Careful of his person, inclined to stylishness
in dress, even before the war, at Newport,
Rhode Island, he was considered among the handsomest,
as well as the most courteous and gracious of
American soldiers.</p>

<p>In the seven days’ battle around Richmond, and
at the sad finality of that wondrous campaign, Malvern
Hill, Magruder bore a distinguished and valorous part.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1862, matters had reached almost a
crisis in Texas. Jealousies, which calmer judgment
now declares unfortunate though not unusual, among
proud and patriotic men, had seriously affected the
success of Confederate arms west of the Mississippi.
A head was needed, and so, of the general officers in the
East, General Magruder was selected by the government,
not only as a successful soldier, but as a high
grade organizer, to assume charge of the affairs of the
great territory west of the Mississippi. This department
had boundless possibilities. It had material for
great soldiers. Its men, accustomed to hardships,
trained to the highest physical endurance by their daily
surroundings, and accustomed to danger and adventure,
were ready to volunteer with readiest alacrity, and to
fight without fear. The splendid achievements of the
trans-Mississippi volunteers will stand the closest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
scrutiny, and the sharpest comparison with any of
those heroes, who by their courage and endurance won
renown for the armies of Tennessee and Northern Virginia.
Their deeds, though not yet justly and fully
chronicled, will, when truly recorded, add still more
resplendence to the name of “Confederate Soldier.”</p>

<p>It was believed that the generals, hitherto operating
with separate commands, would recognize General
Magruder’s superior ability and justly earned reputation,
and that under his guidance, wide experience and
honorably won fame, would co-operate in the campaigns
in Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and Missouri, and when
massed under a man of General Magruder’s genius and
skill would stay threatened Federal invasion and produce
the results their fighting qualities might reasonably
be expected to evolve.</p>

<p>After starting upon his journey, circumstances
arose which recalled him temporarily; but toward the
end of October, in 1862, he reached Texas.</p>

<p>General Magruder early realized the necessity of
holding the line of the Rio Grande, which for more than
twelve hundred miles was the boundary between the
Confederate states and the Republic of Mexico. Along
so many hundreds of miles of waterway, and a line
which presented a great many military difficulties,
it was impossible for the United States, without a
base on the Gulf of Mexico, to interrupt or prevent the
transportation and sale of cotton and the return of
supplies through Mexico, which at that time were
almost absolutely necessary to maintain an organized
army in Texas. The preservation of this territory was
a military necessity. It divided the Federal forces and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
kept a great number of men engaged in defending the
flanks of the armies operating along the Mississippi
River and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>Up to the time of Magruder’s coming, those in
command in Louisiana and Texas had practically
conceded that a full defence of the Texan coast was
impracticable. Galveston, by reason of its peculiar
topographical position, had been abandoned. A small
Federal force was quartered on the wharves, close to the
limits of the city, while the Federal fleet, outside, prevented
egress and ingress to the harbor, and only
waited reinforcements to make a more permanent and
extensive occupation and by closing the avenues to
Mexico, make complete the blockade of the entire
borders of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>General Magruder was considered one of the best
strategists in the Confederate army. By quick movements
and the rapid disposition of troops, he had delayed
General McClellan’s march along the Yorktown
Peninsula several weeks, and he was now resolved to
rid the coast of Texas of Federal invasion and to
restore Galveston to Confederate control. He had but
few of the more powerful resources of military arts at
his command; his artillery was limited; he had no gunboats
and no material from which to make a gunboat
that could ride the ocean storms; but his coming with
a magnificent past of military achievement, and his
personal confidence and courage, quickly inspired the
people in the proximity of Galveston with the highest
opinions of his talents and gallantry, and created hope
where the surroundings declared there could be no hope.</p>

<p>It is fifty miles from Houston to Galveston, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
Brazos River, together with the bayous, afforded
communication with the Gulf, through the harbor at
Galveston to that city. Prompt in action and resolute
of purpose, General Magruder reconnoitered the situation
at Galveston, and determined to re-take the place.
He only proposed to make this attempt after a very
careful survey and an equally careful arrangement of
his plans. The Federal fleet blockading Galveston was
not very extensive, yet was so out of proportion to
anything that the Confederates could bring to bear
upon it, that an attack on it was considered absolutely
foolhardy.</p>

<p>General Magruder had brought with him from
Virginia a few hundred Enfield rifles. These proved
of tremendous value in the operations he was to undertake
at Galveston. Shotguns and ordinary hunting
rifles were not very satisfactory, unless at very close
range, and while General Magruder may not have
anticipated such service as they should render at
Galveston, it was deemed by his followers extremely
fortunate that he had the foresight to introduce, with
his coming to his new field of operation, these English
guns.</p>

<p>Among Federal vessels blockading the port at
Galveston was the <em>Harriet Lane</em>, commanded by Captain
Wainwright; she carried four heavy guns and two
twenty-four-pounders. The <em>Westfield</em>, mounting eight
guns, was a large propeller, and the flagship of Commodore
Renshaw, in command of the blockading fleet.
The <em>Owasco</em>, another propeller, carried eight heavy
guns; the <em>Clifton</em>, a propeller with four heavy guns and
an armed schooner were among the vessels which composed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
the fleet which General Magruder, with the most
inadequate means, proposed to attack and destroy, or
put to flight.</p>

<p>As early as the beginning of 1863, the Confederate
cavalry had been taught to be ready for any service,
whether in scouting, raiding, assaulting infantry or
defending forts. In the demands upon cavalry, the
Confederate authorities were no respecter of persons,
and that a man belonged to the cavalry gave him no
exemption from any service that infantry or artillery
could perform.</p>

<p>By the 1st of November, 1862, General Magruder
issued a call for volunteers. Hand bills were distributed
throughout the city of Houston, calling for enlistments.
It had been given out that Captain Leon Smith would
have charge of the operations by water. These calls
received few responses. Some said it was the hazard
of the expedition, others were unwilling to volunteer
under Captain Smith, a stranger. Call after call fell on
deaf ears, and incredible minds and unwilling hearts, so
far as the citizens and the sailors about Houston were
concerned.</p>

<p>General Magruder’s plans seemed doomed to failure,
when Lieutenant Colonel Bagby of the cavalry suggested
to General Magruder that Colonel Tom Green
was a man of boundless courage and also of unlimited
resources. The history of General Green’s intrepidity,
fortitude, and superior ability in extricating his brigade
from New Mexico a few months before had
spread abroad through Texas, and after this superb
performance, many people thought there was nothing
that General Green could not accomplish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span></p>

<p>General Magruder promptly sent for General Green
and unfolded to him his plan of attack on Galveston,
and suggested to him to take three hundred volunteers
from his cavalry, and with these, on board two steamboats
under command of Captain Leon Smith, aid in
General Magruder’s attempt to recapture Galveston.
But General Green, conscious of his power and confident
of his ability as a leader of men, declined to
embark on boats under the command of Captain Smith,
insisting that, as he was supreme on the land, he must
also be supreme on the sea; and then it was that
General Magruder, pleased with the spirit of the man,
entrusted to Colonel Green the command of the two
river steamers, the <em>Bayou City</em> and the <em>Neptune</em>, which
had been rudely converted into marine rams with a few
cotton bales to protect their wheels and engines.</p>

<p>It required immeasurable courage in such frail and
unseaworthy boats to pass out into the Gulf of Mexico,
or into the harbor at Galveston, and attack war vessels.
General Green, now fifty-one years of age, had led a
most strenuous life, and it was too late for him to take
counsel of fear. He went back to his command full
of the excitement and glamour of glory’s calls and issued
the following order:</p>

<p>“Soldiers, you are called upon to volunteer in a
dangerous expedition. I have never deceived you, I
will not deceive you now. I regard this as the most
desperate enterprise that men ever engaged in. I shall
go, but I do not know that I shall ever return; I do not
know that any who go with me will, and I want no man
to volunteer who is not willing to die for his country
and to die now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>None could say that they misunderstood the purport
of this laconic but stirring and impassioned appeal.
The 5th and 7th regiments had been recruited to a full
quota. Not five in a hundred had ever been to sea;
they knew nothing of the management of any sort of
seagoing vessel, but they did know that General Green
wanted them to go and they did go, largely because
he was going with them. When the two regiments were
drawn up in line and volunteers called for, be it said
to the renown of Texas and to the honor of the Confederate
soldier that, without an instant’s hesitation,
or a moment’s delay, every man in these two regiments
stepped forward and declared his willingness to take
the chances of war in an expedition of which they knew
nothing, except that their beloved commander told
them that while it might lead through the paths of
glory, it also might lead to the grave.</p>

<p>In all the history of the Confederate armies, so
replete with the highest and noblest heroism, there is
no record of anything grander or more inspiring than
this act of the men of these two regiments, offering, in
the face of the warning of their beloved commander,
to go with him, if needs be, even unto present death,
to serve their country.</p>

<p>A cavalryman never likes to give up his horse.
There is a sense of safety, as well as a sense of pride in
the cavalry mount. And when those valiant Texans
went away and committed their steeds to the care of
their comrades, it added a new radiance to their courage
and valor. Ready to leave their beasts to enter upon
an element of which they knew nothing and engage in an
enterprise of which they were profoundly ignorant, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
because, through the voice of their commander, they
heard the call of country bidding them go to meet the
foes of the land they loved, was both an unusual and an
extraordinary exhibition of patriotism and of obedience
to duty’s demands.</p>

<p>But, like those with Gideon of old, three hundred
alone could assume the dangers and win the honors of
this peculiar engagement.</p>

<p>Some members of the 4th Regiment heard of the
expedition, and these hurried forward to offer their
services, but they were reluctantly denied the valued
privilege, and ordered back to their command. Satisfied
to obey, they were filled with grief which later
became even more poignant when they understood the
result of the splendid victory of which they were denied
a share.</p>

<p>It was a difficult task to determine who should go,
in face of the universal and intrepid desire manifested
by these volunteers, to take part in this desperate and
dangerous enterprise.</p>

<p>With that abandon of courage that marks the really
brave, these three hundred soldiers, one-half from the
5th and one-half from the 7th Regiment, marched down
to the wharf at Houston, and took passage on the
<em>Bayou City</em> and <em>Neptune</em>.</p>

<p>General Green remained with the <em>Bayou City</em>. The
<em>Neptune</em>, the faster boat, was commanded by Lieutenant
Colonel Bagby, on which were volunteers from two
artillery companies. But the main fighters and the
great fighting machine, the real men behind the guns,
were those who handled the Enfield rifles which General
Magruder brought over from the far East.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>With such unworthy seagoing vessels, protected
with a few bales of cotton, likely to be blown up by the
first well-directed shell, only the most valiant of men
would have undertaken so hazardous an enterprise.
The remaining men of the 4th, 5th and 7th Cavalry,
composing Sibley’s brigade, had been dispatched to
Galveston to engage in the assault by land and the
defense of the guns on the beach.</p>

<p>General Magruder led the land forces in person.
Along the wharves and shores of the bay, all the Confederate
artillery was put in position. There was little,
if any, protection to the guns or gunners. They were
coming out in the open to fight the men who were
protected in ships, and they were eager for the unequal
fray.</p>

<p>General Magruder had announced that he would
fire the first gun, and that when this was heard, all the
artillery should turn loose upon the Federal fleet.</p>

<p>Under Colonel Cook, five hundred men plunged
into water waist deep, carrying upon their shoulders
the scaling ladders, upon which to climb upon the barricades
held by the Federals on the remains of the City
Wharf.</p>

<p>Neither wind nor wave had aught of terror for these
splendid knights of the sea, who, in the darkness of
the night, guided only by the pale stars, encumbered
with guns and ladders, were hunting for their foes, who,
safely barricaded, were waiting to send death-dealing
missiles into their ranks. On land, such an assault had
terrifying elements, but wading out into the sea, with
neither beacons nor torches to guide their steps, carrying
or pulling scaling ladders, by which alone they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
could hope to engage an enemy entrenched high above
them upon wooden wharves, reaches to the sublimest
heights of human courage.</p>

<p>The dismounted cavalry had been brought within
a short distance of Galveston, and when the first gun
was fired, with brave and steady heads and fleet of
foot, they pressed forward to the front, on the line
held by the venturesome artillery.</p>

<p>The Federal ships were not slow to take their part
in this magnificent night pageant. Shells and bombs
and shot plowed through the walls and over the fortifications
and played hide and seek amongst the guns
and caissons, that stood out on the land with distinctness,
when the flashes of the cannon lit up the weird
scenes of the fateful hour. The men in line on the shore
were unable to reach their enemies, who were safely
anchored out in harbor. Though their position was
made uncomfortable by the fierceness of the fire, none
flinched and none sought to avoid the consequence
of the unequal affray.</p>

<p>So close were the combatants together that shells
alternating with grape and canister speeded forth
from the Federal gunboats, and from midnight until
morn this contest was waged. From two o’clock until
the dawn of day, fierce and fast flew the shells; and
the roar of artillery and the flashes of the guns made
the bay a scene of terror.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp56" id="p205" style="max-width: 46.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p205.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">GENERAL JOHN B. MAGRUDER</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Magruder turned his eyes anxiously towards the
direction from which his navy should come. The men
aboard the steamboats heard the sound of artillery and,
catching the inspiration of the hour, with illy suppressed
anxiety and impatience, urged that they push forward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>into the midst of the conflict. They had waited from
midnight until four in the morning for the sign which
would bid them to enter the arena, and when at early
morn they heard the call for them to come, it was with
difficulty that their commanders could restrain their
impatient ardor.</p>

<p>As they sailed down the Bayou, they caught sight
of the flashes which marked the place where the artillery
duel was being fought out. The clear starlight, with
the moon gone down, was a splendid background upon
which was painted the illuminations created by rapidly
firing ordnance. This was more brilliant and more
beautiful than any display that fireworks might produce.</p>

<p>The roll of the cannon was sweet music to the
patriots now afloat and being propelled with quickening
revolutions of the wheels into the turmoil and
excitement.</p>

<p>The Federal ship, <em>Harriet Lane</em>, being nearest the
shore, was the first to receive the attention of the
Confederate navy. The <em>Neptune</em>, the fastest of the
flotilla, came quickly within range of the Federal fleet,
and in swinging around to the side of the <em>Harriet Lane</em>,
was struck amidships and quickly sank. The water
was so shallow that it did not reach the upper part of
the vessel. Without being deterred from the serious
business in which they were engaged, the cavalry
mounted on the highest portion of the boat and with
their Enfield rifles poured a deadly fire upon every
part of the <em>Harriet Lane</em>, and practically drove her
gunners from their posts.</p>

<p>The <em>Bayou City</em>, not so swift, but manned by none
the less determined soldiers and sailors, swung promptly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
into action. Compared with the <em>Lane</em>, she was helpless
in an artillery fight, but those aboard of this frail ship
had no dread of any danger that the exigencies of the
hour could precipitate. As she advanced into the battle,
her best piece of artillery burst and the valiant captain,
Wier, who had volunteered to direct the guns, fell dead
by their side.</p>

<p>Disregarding all ideas of prudence, and casting to
the winds or the waters all fear, the <em>Bayou City</em>, with
her improvised ram, made straight for the <em>Harriet Lane</em>
and drove her iron nose into her sides. The blow was
given with such force that it disabled the <em>Harriet Lane</em>;
the vessels appeared as one forum of raging conflict.
With grappling irons, the Confederates held the two
vessels fast together, and then in obedience to the call
of General Green, every man from the <em>Bayou City</em>
sprang upon the deck of the unfortunate <em>Lane</em>.</p>

<p>There were no words of parley, there were no calls
for surrender, but the brave Texans, under their valiant
commander, with Enfield rifles and their swords, made
quick work of the crew of the Federal ship, and in the
briefest period the storm quieted to the stillness of
death.</p>

<p>The commander of the <em>Lane</em>, Captain Wainwright,
was killed. Lieutenant Lee, his junior officer, was
mortally wounded. There was nothing to do but ask
for quarter. The Federal troops on the wharves, who,
by reason of the shortness of the Confederates’ scaling
ladders, had escaped capture, now surrendered, and
fate with relentless and pitiless edict, gave the Federals
over to complete defeat.</p>

<p>When Captain Lee, a Confederate officer, one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
those manning the <em>Bayou City</em>, looked into the faces
of the Federal prisoners, he was shocked to see that the
dying lieutenant on the <em>Harriet Lane</em> was his own son.</p>

<p>Commodore Renshaw, in command of the <em>Westfield</em>,
was not disposed to rush away and leave his comrades
on the <em>Harriet Lane</em> unsupported. The shallowness of
the water and the limited space in which these vessels
had maneuvered caused the <em>Westfield</em>, Commodore
Renshaw’s boat, to run aground. The <em>Mary Boardman</em>,
one of the transports, gamely essayed to help the <em>Westfield</em>,
and the <em>Clifton</em>, another propeller, tendered her
assistance in her extremity. The laurel wreath had
been woven for the brow of the daring, fearless Confederates,
and no effort of the brave Federals could
stay the losses. When the enterprise was first considered,
only hope stirred the hearts of the men in
gray. They scarcely calculated that, under the most
favorable conditions, any such consequence could come
from the expedition. Brave and fearless, they were
not prepared for such a wonderful result. True, they
were guided by Magruder’s genius, aided by Smith’s
skill, led by Green’s immeasurable courage, helped by
Bagby’s experience, impelled by Scurry’s valor, encouraged
by Cook’s dauntless bravery, and inspired by
McNeill’s calm and imperturbable gallantry; but none
dared to believe that so much could be accomplished
in so brief a period, or such transcendent success crown
even the bravest of men, facing such difficulties with
such splendid reward. The Federal vessels which
escaped sailed away. They left Galveston a Confederate
possession. The survivors were glad to go
beyond the reach of horsemen, who were as reckless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
and enterprising on the sea as they had proven
themselves on the land.</p>

<p>It was a great victory. It cost the Confederates
twenty-six killed and one hundred and seventeen
wounded, but the success of the enterprise and the
flight of the Federal vessels from Galveston set abroad
a great wave of enthusiasm and patriotism. Few could
realize that such glorious results could be obtained by
men, handicapped by insufficient resources, even when
sustained by the highest courage and noblest spirit.
What had been done stirred the hearts of all the people
of Texas. They recognized in General Magruder an
illustrious soldier, and in the Texas cavalry, whether
on land or sea, an invincible host, which had the apparent
power to wrest from fate victory under any conditions,
however adverse or stormy.</p>

COLONEL ROY S. CLUKE’S KENTUCKY RAID,<br>
FEBRUARY-MARCH, 1863</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">On the 14th of February, 1863, a small brigade
of Kentucky cavalry assembled at McMinnville,
Tennessee. Seven hundred and fifty
men constituted the organization. The 8th Kentucky
cavalry, of which Roy S. Cluke was colonel, Major
Robert S. Bullock commanding, was to form the basis
of the men to be used in an expedition into Central
Kentucky. Lieutenant Colonel Cicero Coleman of
the regiment had been seriously wounded at Hartsville
on the 7th of December, and still suffering, was
unable to go. In addition to the 8th Kentucky cavalry,
the 9th Kentucky cavalry furnished two companies
under the command of Colonel Robert G. Stoner,
who was one of the bravest and most enterprising of
Morgan’s men. These constituted the first battalion.
Companies C and I of Gano’s regiment and Company
A of the 2nd Kentucky, under command of Major
Theophilus Steele, constituted the second battalion.
Later, in Wayne County, Companies D and I of Chenault’s
(the 11th) regiment, were added to Stoner’s
battalion. Colonel Cluke was allowed a couple of brass
cannon, howitzers, affectionately called by Morgan’s
men the “bull pups.” They never did very great
damage, but they made a loud noise. They looked to
an enemy much bigger than they were, and if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
were not very effective with their shots, they were
oftentimes extremely forceful with their “barking.”</p>

<p>No seven hundred and fifty men were ever more
ably commanded. Colonel Cluke was not only a brave
but a brilliant officer.</p>

<p>General Morgan furnished his two brothers as part
of the staff. The best possible material was designated
for this service. The men chosen for this raid were
thoroughly acquainted with most of the territory
through which Colonel Cluke would necessarily have
to pass. The companies of the 11th would know Madison
and the adjoining counties, Companies C and I of
the 3rd Kentucky (Gano’s) would know Scott and
Franklin Counties. Company A of the 2nd would be
familiar with almost the entire Bluegrass, and Cluke’s
own regiment would know Kentucky from Maysville
to Springfield and Somerset. He started out with the
advantage of men who had full and complete knowledge
of the country through which he was to operate. This
added much to the efficiency of the little brigade.
Lieutenant Shuck, of the 8th Kentucky, was given
the command of the advance guard. The importance
of the advance guard in cavalry campaigns cannot be
over-estimated. It requires officers of great coolness,
of much dash, dauntless courage, and men who never
counted the cost and who would follow in the face of
any danger wherever they were ordered to go. In
such an expedition scouts would also play a most
useful and prominent part. To Lieutenant Hopkins,
of the 2nd, and S. P. Cunningham, of the 8th, were
given the choice and control of the scouts. Neither
the advance guard nor the scouts made a very large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
force. All told, they did not exceed forty, but these
were men upon whom any commander could rely at
any hour of day or night and in any place whither
they might come.</p>

<p>At McMinnville a hundred rounds of ammunition
were counted out and six days’ rations were issued to
the men upon the morning that they marched away.
Nature did not appear to be in harmony with the purposes
of this expedition. The weather was extremely
inclement, and, for that part of Tennessee, extraordinarily
cold. Hardly had the line been formed
until sleet and rain and snow came violently down.
These, with the tramping of the horses’ feet, soon made
veritable sloughs of the dirt roads over which the
march was progressing. The line pursued ran through
Sparta, Obey City, Jamestown, in Tennessee, to the
Kentucky border. This country presented a scene
of universal desolation. In times of peace it was not
fully able to supply the needs of its own inhabitants,
and now that armies had traversed it for more than a
year, there was not sufficient forage at any one place
to feed one company of horsemen. The six days’
coarse rations given the men in their haversacks at
McMinnville would keep them from want, but the
horses, with hardest possible service in the midst of
fearfully disagreeable weather, could only hope for
scantiest and most insufficient provender. The entire
one hundred and ten miles from McMinnville to the
Cumberland River had been, before this period,
practically eaten out of house and home, and there was
little left for the strangers who might pass these
mountain ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>The Cumberland River was the only real barrier
to this small force as it entered Kentucky. Once it
was passed, there would be so many roads for the invaders
to take that it would be impossible for the defenders
to either stop their march or seriously impede
their journeyings. The banks of the Cumberland were
full. The Federals on the north side had taken all
boats across to prevent passage by an enemy. Luckily,
a canoe was found hidden away, large enough to convey
Colonel Stoner and Lieutenant Hopkins and several
men over the stream. These silently and stealthily
paddled across. Some countryman, without the fear
of “blue coats” before his eyes, had stored this craft
in the bushes along a small tributary. He had probably
used it in secret ferrying of goods to the south bank.
With plenty of everything on the north side, it was not
treason to keep a canoe hidden, with which, when no
picket was present, or his eye not open, to run across
the boundary calico, sugar, coffee or other necessities,
so essential to the war-despoiled women and children
on the south side, upon whom starvation and want
had laid heavy hand.</p>

<p>Colonel Stoner and his cavalry comrades were
fortunate and shrewd enough to surprise and capture
the Federal pickets who were posted to guard Stigall’s
Ferry, a short distance north of Burnside, where Colonel
Cluke had proposed and now determined to cross. A
couple of flatboats and a coal barge were discovered
amongst the Federal possessions, and these were quickly
brought over. Now, in the face of vigorous foes,
action was the watchword of the hour. With their
saddles and guns, the men hastily rushed into the flatboats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
and poled and paddled over the stream. A more
desperate mode of crossing was assigned to the horses.
It was still bitter cold, and the poor beasts were forced
into the river and compelled to swim its rapid currents.
They could not speak, and they hesitated to plunge in;
but the shouts and belaborings of their apparently
cruel masters were more potent than their fears, and
with only their noses above the water, and their bodies
beneath the frigid waves, lapped into motion by the
piercing winds, they swam diagonally across to the
opposite shore. Already weakened by a trying march
of more than a hundred miles, so great was the shock
to the animals that a number of them were chilled to
death and died upon the bank as they emerged from
the water.</p>

<p>The severity of the winter rendered very rapid
marching impossible. On the 19th of February, the
little army reached Somerset, the county seat of Pulaski.
A strong Federal force was stationed there, but
alarmed by reports of an army of Confederates approaching
from Knoxville, they hurriedly retreated to
Danville, forty-five miles away and left a clear road
for Colonel Cluke. Here a full supply of stores had
been collected. Their guardians were in such a great
hurry to ride to Danville that they forgot, or neglected,
to destroy them. This was a gracious windfall
for the Confederates. The Government and the
sutlers had the very things these benumbed men and
horses most needed. After supplying his tired beasts
and hungry soldiers with all that was necessary to
comfort, warm and feed them, and burning the remainder,
Colonel Cluke made a forced march of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
twenty-eight miles to Mount Vernon. If he accomplished
his work it was important to surprise his enemies,
and in such work Colonel Cluke was a master hand.
Finding nothing here, he pushed on to Richmond,
Kentucky. The roads were wet, sloppy, slushy, and
still blinding snowstorms and heavy rains with chilling
currents, rushing down from the north, attempted to
bid defiance to these sturdy riders, to stay their advance
and render their march more harassing and
tedious.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Cunningham, who was with Lieutenant
Hopkins in command of the scouts, was a man of almost
superhuman courage and of a genius and resource
that entitled him to higher command. A few miles
out on the pike from Richmond, advancing with eight
men, he found a picket post of the Federals, consisting
of four videttes. Challenged, he declared that he and
his followers were friends. Dressed in blue coats, such
as they were wearing, and which were a part of the
Somerset find, he persuaded the Federals that they were
a detachment of Woolford’s Federal cavalry which
was returning from Tennessee to Kentucky to assist
in repelling the raid of Morgan’s men. He told the
questioning videttes that all the Federal forces were
now concentrating at Lexington, that General John C.
Breckinridge, by way of Cumberland Gap, had already
entered the State with ten thousand Confederate
infantry. The sergeant quickly became communicative
and gave Cunningham a statement of the location and
strength of all the Federal commands, and finally
invited the Confederates to go to a house a short distance
away, where the remainder of the picket detail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
was stationed. Cunningham cheerfully accepted the
proffered hospitality of his new-made friends, but upon
reaching the house he was somewhat embarrassed to
find that twenty-four soldiers constituted this outpost.
He persuaded the commander to send back one of his
men with two of the Confederates to get information
about some other of the Federal forces that were
coming a short distance behind. The Federal, thus
despatched, when out of sight of the post, quickly found
himself a prisoner. Hopkins, Cunningham’s associate
commander of scouts, in a brief while, arrived on the
scene with eight new blue-coated riders. The Confederates,
now two-thirds in number of the Federal
garrison, without parley or argument immediately
announced their identity and attacked their hospitable
and surprised friends, and killed one, wounded two,
and made all the others prisoners. The generosity of
the course pursued by Cunningham was open to
serious criticism, but warriors do not carry copies of
Chesterfield’s rules in their pockets and find little use
for their precepts and teachings on cavalry raids.</p>

<p>No outpost was ever captured more cleverly or
more completely surprised, and few similar incidents
reflect more credit on the actors.</p>

<p>Ten miles away there were two hundred and fifty
Federal cavalry. This was just exactly what Cluke
wanted. Fresh horses, cavalry saddles and ammunition
would be a great comfort to the men who rode
with him, but the story of Breckinridge’s coming had
reached Richmond. Rumors traveled in those days
on the winds—and the Federal cavalry hastily decamped.
Major Steele, with three companies, pursued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
these fleeing troops. He overtook them at Comb’s
Ferry, on the Kentucky River, twelve miles from Lexington,
and, fighting and running, drove the Federal
column into the city. In attempting to capture some
videttes, who had indicated they would surrender,
one of the Federals fired his rifle at Steele’s breast,
but a thick Mexican blanket folded about his body
saved his life and protected him from injury except a
broken rib. It was a serious misfortune that a man so
brave and enterprising, so thoroughly acquainted with
the geography of the territory over which the operations
of the next thirty-five days would extend, should
at this critical moment, became incapacitated for active
service.</p>

<p>Colonel Cluke was now far into Kentucky. He was
over two hundred miles from where he started. He
had been out nine days. He had no easy job. He had
worked his way, he had seen much of the enemy and
at every point had mystified and alarmed the Federal
commands. He and his subordinates had managed
to escape from very serious battle. Detachments
were sent in every direction to increase the terror of
the Federal forces at Lexington, Mount Sterling, Paris.
They threatened, attacked and captured several important
positions, and his enemies, magnifying his
forces, sat down inactive until they should determine
whether Breckinridge and the ten thousand infantry
behind this dashing cavalry advance were really coming,
and until they could count Cluke’s followers and
figure up just what they would go against if they might
force him to battle.</p>

<p>Cluke’s men who lived in the immediate vicinity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
of Lexington, Mount Sterling, Winchester and Richmond
were granted temporary furloughs in order to
visit their friends, renew their wardrobes, and, if
desirable, replace their mounts, and enjoy the association
with their loved ones whom they had left four
and a half months before. Only the complete mystification
and demoralization of his foes could justify so astute
a leader as Cluke in risking such a proceeding.
Happy days for these bold riders. The four and a half
months of absence had been full of excitement, adventures
and war experiences. The march out of
Kentucky, the Battle of Hartsville, the Christmas
raid, were stories that sounded well in the telling and
impressed those who stayed at home with the courage
and marvelous achievements of the narrators who, in
the partial eyes of home folks, at least, were transformed
into real heroes,—these boys who had gone away
to fight for the South.</p>

<p>Ceaseless activity marked every hour of those who
had not been furloughed. Demonstrations on Paris
confined the garrison there, while Stoner, moving back
to Mount Sterling, found a Federal Kentucky cavalry
regiment, which, with a small force, he promptly
attacked and drove away. He captured many prisoners
and the road by which these Federals retreated was
strewn with overcoats, guns, haversacks and wagons,
which unmistakably demonstrated that some of those
who were hunting Cluke did not just now desire a formal
introduction.</p>

<p>On the 24th of February Colonel Cluke had concentrated
his command at Mount Sterling, and the
whole day was spent in collecting and distributing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
horses, equipments and arms. By this time the Federals
had become somewhat doubtful and inquisitive
about the strength of the invaders. The ten thousand
infantry did not show up from Cumberland Gap, and
they began to realize that the Confederate detachment,
which had given them all this trouble and hard riding
and had alarmed them so terribly, was probably not,
after all, a very great army. All sorts of dreams and
visions came to the Federal pursuers. Colonel Runkle
of the 45th Ohio Regiment, Acting Brigadier General,
reported: “I was confident of cutting the enemy to
pieces between Richmond and the Kentucky River.”
Of his march to Winchester he wrote, “The inhabitants
reported that they threw their dead into the stream
(Slate) and carried off the wounded.”</p>

<p>A Federal cavalry brigade made a dash at Mount
Sterling, Cluke’s headquarters. Only two hundred
men of the command were on hand at that particular
moment. Furloughs had decimated Cluke’s forces
and they were glad to get out of the town, but they were
gladder still that the Federals did not pursue them. A
Federal officer, reporting the occurrence, wrote: “The
rebels had a heavy guard out here and made a show of
fighting, but when we fired on them they rang the bells
in town and all went out in a huddle. The rebels
burned their wagons and threw everything away they
had stolen.” He also said, “We heard heavy firing
yesterday below here in direction of Jeffersonville.
Suppose Miner has cut them off, which I ordered him
to do.” The cutting off was more imaginative than real.</p>

<p>The sound of the Federal guns had not died
away before four hundred of Cluke’s furloughed men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
hastened to the relief of their retreating companions.
The Federal cavalry established itself at Mount Sterling
but left Colonel Cluke in command of the
surrounding country.</p>

<p>Oftentimes in partisan war, strategy is as important
as men. Lieutenant Cunningham was sent to threaten
Lexington. Among the scouts was Clark Lyle. Young,
vigorous, brave and enterprising, he now undertook a
most perilous mission. Cunningham had sent a spy
disguised in Federal uniform to the headquarters of
the officer commanding at Mount Sterling, and this
shrewd messenger was smart enough to put in his pocket
some blank printed forms which lay upon the table
of the commandant. One of these was filled up as an
order purporting to be from the commander at Lexington,
Kentucky, directing the commander at Mount
Sterling to march instantly to Paris, twenty miles
north of Lexington to repel a raid which was impending
by the Confederates against the Kentucky Central
Railroad, which connected Cincinnati and Lexington.</p>

<p>Lyle, dressed in full Federal uniform, rode into
Mount Sterling at the top of his speed, lashing his
horse at every step. The animal was reeking with foam.
He rushed to the headquarters of the commander,
Colonel Runkle, and delivered the orders. The bugles
were instantly sounded, and the Federal cavalry brigade
moved out to Paris. Hardly had the sound of the jingling
sabres ceased along the macadam road which led
from Mount Sterling to Paris, before Cluke, with his
reorganized force, re-entered the town and captured
the garrison and the stores. He found Mount Sterling
a most delightful place to remain. It was only twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
miles from Winchester and only a few more from
Richmond. The predominating element was Confederate,
and Colonel Cluke remained for some eight
days, enjoying the hospitality of his people and feasting
upon the good things with which the Bluegrass was
replete. The Federal commander, concerning this,
said: “Found order false on 27th. I received order to
pursue Cluke and use him up, which I proceeded to do.”
A Federal major, not to be outdone in giving an account
of his past, said that he had received orders to
find Cluke and that he “moved forward like hell.”
Somehow or other these active and ferocious commanders
never got where Cluke was. The Federals,
however, became dissatisfied with Cluke’s occupation
and coming in full force, they drove him across Slate
Creek into the Kentucky Mountains. Detachments
with Stoner, coming past Middletown and around
Mount Sterling, were roughly handled by the Federals,
but with small loss they reached the main force, when
Cluke, hearing that Humphrey Marshall with three
thousand soldiers was advancing into Kentucky, fell
back to Hazel Green, Wolfe County, thirty-five miles
southeast.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p223" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p223.jpg" alt="">

<p class="center no-indent"><em>What Fifty Years have done for the Commander-in-Chief</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Established for a few days at Hazel Green, an epidemic,
a cross between erysipelas and measles, appeared,
and half of Cluke’s small command were disabled with
this dangerous and treacherous malady. Had the
Federals pursued him at this time they would have
captured a large portion of his command in bed or
camp, and certainly they would have made prisoners
of the sick, and if hard pressed would surely have
either forced him to return to the mountains or be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>himself made a captive. Though so many of his men
were sick, Cluke sent Colonel Stoner back to Montgomery
County, in the vicinity of Mount Sterling.
This was done just to let the Federals know that he and
his men were around and if necessary would show fight.
No better man than Stoner could have been found
for such a mission. The Federals, getting increased
courage from the Confederate retreat, began to demonstrate
themselves and advanced upon Hazel Green.
Cluke, not to be outdone, moved further east, thirty
miles to Salyersville in Magoffin County, still deeper
into the mountains. The season was unpropitious.
The fountains of heaven seemed to open. Rains came
down in torrents. There were days when horses and
men, with cold, chilling rains, were almost incapacitated
from service. On the 19th of March, Cluke,
through his scouts, discovered that he was apparently
entirely surrounded. Fifteen hundred Federals had
marched by his front and gained a position in his rear.
Eastward, from Louisa, one thousand men were rushing
upon him, and westwardly, from Proctor, on the
Kentucky River, in Lee County, eight hundred more
Federals were moving to crush this bold and defiant
Confederate raider. The forces had not fully recovered
from the attack of the disease at Hazel Green, and
at this time Cluke had not more than five hundred
effectives.</p>

<p>It was a bold thought, but with true military instinct,
he concluded that the only thing to do was to
attack his enemy where he was least expecting it.
He was only sixty miles from Mount Sterling. The
roads were almost impassable, and these would render<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
the march extremely difficult, trying and laborious.
He assumed wisely that the enemy would not suspect
that he would reappear at Mount Sterling. Rapidly
as possible, marching through slush and rain and across
swollen streams, he passed through and around his
foes. The combination of rain, cold and the spattering
of men and horses by the slush created by the
tramp of the column, rendered the conditions surrounding
this march almost unbearable. Either of
the three elements would have been distressing, but
combined they became well-nigh intolerable. The
author had many experiences of war’s hardships but,
in common with his comrades, he considered this ride
from Salyersville to Slate Creek the most arduous and
disagreeable of all things that touched the life of
Morgan’s men. The ride around Lebanon in January,
1863, on the Christmas raid, brought almost incomparable
suffering. Those who endured the cold of that
dreadful night believed that they had reached the
limit of human endurance. There the awful freezing
was the chiefest element of suffering; but the men
who rode with Cluke from Salyersville to Slate Creek
declared that the hardship was even more terrible for
man and mount than the ride around Lebanon.</p>

<p>Before leaving the sick men, Cluke’s men scattered
out into the mountains. A majority of the people of
Wolfe County sympathized with the South, and it was
not difficult to find friendly homes for the convalescent
fugitives. The Licking River and all its tributaries
were full and in many places over the banks, but the
horses could swim and the men could go over in canoes
and flatboats, and in a real emergency they could and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
did swim with their mounts. Colonel Cluke made a
fierce and hard drive at Mount Sterling. On the morning
of the 21st of March he appeared before the town
and demanded its surrender. This was firmly declined.
Heading one of the columns himself, he charged into
the very heart of the city. The Federal garrison was
driven back into the Court House. The Federals away
from the Court House had posted themselves in residences
along the streets, but the torch, the axe and the
sledge hammer soon made a passway up to a hotel
which was occupied by a number of Federals with the
lower story used as a hospital. Here a flag of truce was
run up. Cunningham and Lieutenant McCormack
and six men advanced under the flag. Upon reaching
the building, they were jeeringly informed that it was
the sick who had surrendered and not the well soldiers,
and these threatened to fire upon Cunningham and
his comrades from the upper rooms, if they undertook
to escape from the building. The outlook was extremely
gloomy. Lieutenant Saunders suggested that
each Confederate take a sick Federal soldier and hold
him up in front while they escaped from the position
into which their courage—and some might say rashness—had
brought them. Putting this plan into immediate
execution the retreat was begun. It was impossible
for the Federals to fire without killing their sick
comrades, but Cunningham and his friends were inconsiderate
enough to set fire to the hospital before
they so unceremoniously left, and in a little while,
through charging and fighting, the men who had
refused to surrender and had threatened to fire on
Cunningham, found themselves in a most unfortunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
predicament. The lower story was beginning to blaze.
The sick were carried out, but the well men who had
declined to respect Cunningham’s flag of truce, must
either burn up, jump out of the windows, or be shot
down. No men ever more gladly surrendered, and the
captive Federals and the Confederates all united in a
common effort to save them from their impending
doom. The Federal prisoners and the Confederates
together worked to quench the flames which had been
started under the hospital.</p>

<p>Time was of the very essence of victory. None
could tell at what moment the Federals, left behind
at Salyersville, might put in an appearance. Garrisons
at Lexington, Paris and Winchester would soon
hear the news of Cluke’s coming and might ride to the
rescue of their friends. Every man caught the spirit
of haste. True it was Sunday morning, but war does
not respect any day of rest. To have lost, after the
brilliant strategy of the dreadful march from Salyersville
would leave regrets that no future success could
palliate. Every Confederate was terribly in earnest,
and no laggards on that otherwise peaceful day of
rest were found in Cluke’s following. Captain Virgil
Pendleton of Company D, 8th Kentucky, was mortally
wounded and died shortly afterwards. No braver
soldier or more loyal patriot ever gave his life for the
South. Captain Terrill and Lieutenant Maupin of
Chenault’s regiment were seriously wounded. Both
brave officers, they fell at the front.</p>

<p>The work was short, sharp and decisive. In six
hours the agony was past. Two hundred and twenty
wagons, five hundred mules and one thousand stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
of arms were the reward the captors had for their
heroic services. Three killed and ten or fifteen wounded
was the penalty paid by Cluke for his victory. The
enemy lost a few more, and three hundred and one were
paroled.</p>

<p>The forces which had been sent to catch Cluke were
not long in finding that their enemy had evaded them
and, rapidly leaving the mountains, had gone down
into the Bluegrass and won a victory. They promptly
followed on, searching for their agile foe.</p>

<p>Cluke’s successful work incited spirited criticism
of the conduct of the Federal commanders. Colonel
Runkle and General Gilmore appear not to have
agreed about the work done in this campaign. Colonel
Runkle, with great complacency, reported: “As for
my men, they have ridden day after day and night
after night, without sleep or rest, and have pursued
eagerly and willingly when so exhausted that they fell
from their horses.” On this report General Gilmore
endorsed: “How his men could have been without
sleep and his horses without rest during the two days
he halted at Paris, I cannot understand.” Captain
Radcliffe, Company E, 10th Kentucky Cavalry, who
capitulated at Mount Sterling, was, by the department
commander, dishonorably dismissed from the military
service, subject to the approval of the President, for
his disgraceful surrender of the place.</p>

<p>Later he was honorably acquitted by a Court of
Enquiry and cleared of all imputation upon his
character as a soldier and restored to his command.
Somebody had blundered and a scapegoat must be
found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>So far as written reports are concerned, Colonel
Cluke made only one return, which is as follows:
“Rockville, Rowan County, Kentucky, March 24th,
1863. I reached the above place last evening, just
from Mount Sterling. On the morning of the 21st I
moved with my command direct to Mount Sterling,
where I learned there were between three hundred and
four hundred of the enemy guarding a large supply
of commissary and quartermaster’s stores, together
with the good citizens of the place. After crossing
Licking River I found the road in such condition that
it was almost impossible to move my artillery. I
placed three companies to assist and guard it, with
directions to move on without delay to Mount Sterling.
I then moved with my command to Mount Sterling,
which place I reached about daylight the next morning,
where I found the enemy quartered in the Court
House and adjoining buildings. I immediately demanded
a surrender of the place, which request they
refused to comply with. I then gave them twenty
minutes to get the women and children from town.
That they refused to do also, and fired upon the flag
of truce from the Court House and several other buildings
immediately around the Court House. My
artillery, not coming up in time, I was compelled to fire
the town to dislodge the enemy. After several houses
had been burned, they surrendered the place; but
before surrendering, they kept up a continual firing
from the buildings upon my men, who were protected
by the fences, stables and outbuildings around the
town. I paroled two hundred and eighty-seven privates
(14th Kentucky cavalry) and fourteen officers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
I paroled them to report to you within thirty days,
which I herewith send you. The property destroyed,
belonging to the enemy, will reach I think five hundred
thousand dollars. I occupied the town about six
hours when my scouts reported a large force advancing
from Winchester. I immediately moved in the direction
of Owingsville. I had not proceeded more than
five miles when they made their appearance some two
miles in my rear, numbering about twenty-five hundred
men, with several pieces of artillery. They would not
advance upon me and I quietly advanced on to Owingsville,
without pursuit, and from thence on to the above
place. When I left West Liberty for Mount Sterling,
the enemy, numbering thirteen hundred men with
four pieces of artillery, were at Hazel Green, in pursuit
of my force. They reported and despatched a courier
to Mount Sterling stating that they had me completely
surrounded, but I surprised them by making my
appearance where not expected. General Marshall
is within forty miles of this place, moving on with
sixteen hundred cavalry. He lost his artillery the other
night. The guard placed over it went to sleep and some
Home Guards slipped in on him and carried off the
gun, leaving the carriage and caisson.... I send you
three prisoners of which you will take charge until you
hear from me again.... My command is elegantly
mounted and clothed, in fact in better condition than
they have ever been. If your command was here,
you could clean the State of every Yankee.”</p>

<p>Marching over from Southwestern Virginia, General
Humphrey Marshall had driven the forces which had
gone to capture Cluke at Salyersville back into Central<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
Kentucky. This left Cluke an open way for the return
to Monticello, Wayne County, Kentucky.</p>

<p>After maneuvering with his enemies for some days,
he received orders from General Morgan to march
southward by way of Irvine, McKee, Manchester and
Somerset, to Stigall’s Ferry, where he had crossed the
river some weeks before. He had not been away more
than seven weeks; he had traveled, all told, eight hundred
miles, almost altogether within the line of the
enemy. He was always operating with an inferior
force, but he was ever ready to fight. The history of
war furnished nothing superior to the skill and strategy
of Colonel Cluke in this expedition. He was campaigning
over two hundred miles from his supports; he had
larger, active forces and many strong garrisons about
him, and these were threatening and covering at all
times the only way by which he could return to his
starting place. His daring and skill had braved his
enemies at every turn. He played with them as a cat
with a mouse. Leading them far into the mountains,
he slipped away before they realized that he was gone,
and in the darkness of the night, amid storms, and over
roads believed to be impassable, he made a tremendous
march and pounced down upon an intrenched garrison
more than half as great as the force he carried into the
fight, and then escaped in the immediate presence of a
Federal force five times as large as that which he was
commanding. He destroyed more than a million
dollars’ worth of property. For weeks he defied and
evaded his pursuers and then crossed the Cumberland
River at the same point he had passed it, with his command
well equipped, and reported to his superior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
commander the brilliant experiences without a serious
mishap or defeat during his long stay amidst his
enemies.</p>


<h3>POSTSCRIPT</h3>

<p>Roy Stuart Cluke was born in Clark County,
Kentucky, in 1824. His mother died when he was
only three weeks of age and he was reared by the
family of his grandfather, James Stuart. This grandfather
had served in the Revolutionary War under
Washington. Allotted a large tract of land for his
revolutionary services, he settled in Clark County and
had for his homestead a thousand acre farm near the
junction of Clark, Bourbon and Montgomery Counties,
by the side of a great spring, known as “Stuart Spring.”
In the early days of Kentucky, water was even more
valuable than rich land.</p>

<p>James Stuart had four sons, and all were soldiers
from Kentucky in the War of 1812.</p>

<p>After such education as the local schools of his
period could give, he was sent to a military school at
Bardstown, Kentucky. Shortly after attaining his
majority he volunteered for service in the Mexican
war, and went with a company of Kentucky cavalry
commanded by John Stuart Williams, his cousin,
afterwards brigadier general in the Confederate army
and United States Senator from Kentucky. The
company made a most enviable record in Mexico.
Briefly before the commencement of the Civil War,
he organized and trained a company of cavalry which
was attached to the State Guard. This company was
noted for its thorough drill, its magnificent mounts,
its splendid equipment and its dashing riders. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
General Bragg invaded the State in 1862 he organized
a regiment of cavalry composed largely of men from
the Bluegrass counties. More than eight hundred
men enlisted in this regiment, which was called the
8th Kentucky. When only a portion of his regiment
had been enlisted, he was sent to harass General George
W. Morgan, the Federal officer who was making his
masterly retreat from Cumberland Gap, through the
mountains of Kentucky. The 8th Kentucky subsequently
became a part of General John H. Morgan’s
command. His regiment was actively engaged in
service from August, 1862, until his capture, July 26th,
1863. He was at Hartsville on December 6th, 1862,
on the Christmas raid, and led an independent expedition
into Kentucky in February and March, 1863.
He was captured on the 26th of July, 1863, with General
Morgan, at Salineville, Columbiana County, Ohio,
and was conveyed to the Ohio penitentiary with the
other officers of the command, and kept there for some
months and subsequently removed to Johnson’s Island,
Sandusky, Ohio. He loved the excitement and din of
war. He chafed under his confinement in the penitentiary
and at Johnson’s Island. It was reported that
he had been poisoned in prison. This, however, was
denied and later was discredited. He died under
distressing circumstances in December, 1863. There
was an epidemic of diphtheria among the Confederate
officers at Johnson’s Island about the time of Colonel
Cluke’s death. A man of marvelously prepossessing
physique, he enjoyed the friendship of the officers of
the prison. He had been allowed to visit the office
and read the newspapers. While thus employed one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
morning, with his strong, silvery voice, with military
calmness, he said, “Gentlemen, I will be dead in a few
minutes. I have only one request to make of you as
soldiers and gentlemen. Leave my arms folded across
my bosom like a warrior and tell them to place my
Mexican War sabre by my side. Telegraph my cousin
and foster brother, Samuel G. Stuart, of Winchester,
Kentucky; request him to come for my body and bury
me next to my mother in the old Stuart graveyard at
home.” He folded his arms, the paper fell from his
now nerveless grasp, his head drooped on his breast.
Even his enemies were impressed at his calmness and
courage in the presence of the great enemy. They
rushed to his side. The prison physician felt his pulse
and lifting his head from his chest, where he was
listening for the heart beats, he turned his face to those
aside and said, “He is dead.” The drama was ended
and in pathetic gloom the curtain fell on the brilliant
and gallant soldier.</p>

<p>Six feet, four inches tall, splendidly proportioned,
with a magnificent suit of brown hair and whiskers,
graceful as any man who ever rode to war, as brave
as the bravest, calm, cool, fierce in danger, his presence
was always an inspiration to his followers. He was
idolized by his men. He had won the confidence and
admiration of General Morgan and all who were
associated with him in the division. Had he escaped
on the Ohio raid, he would have been made a brigadier
general. There was universal sorrow that so splendid
a life should go out with such darkened surroundings.
His remains were brought to his native State and deposited
first where he asked, in the old Stuart graveyard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
and then later removed to the Lexington cemetery.
In this wondrously beautiful “City of the Dead”
he rests close to his great leader, Morgan, within a
stone’s throw of the grave of General John C. Breckinridge,
just across the way a little bit from General
Roger W. Hanson and Colonel W. C. P. Breckinridge,
and under the shadow of Kentucky’s memorial to
Henry Clay.</p>

<p>Those who loved and followed him have built a
simple granite monument on which is inscribed:</p>

<p class="center no-indent">
“Roy Stuart Cluke. 1824-1863.<br>
Colonel of the 8th Kentucky Cavalry, C.S.A.<br>
Erected by his Comrades.”<br>

SHELBY’S MISSOURI RAID, SEPTEMBER, 1863</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Certain parts of Missouri were settled, almost
entirely, by Kentuckians. In the earlier days
there had been a tremendous emigration from
Kentucky to Indiana and Illinois, and when these
States had received a large quota of inhabitants
from Kentucky, the overflow from that State then
turned to Missouri. Its counties and towns were
designated by Kentucky names which were brought
over by these new people from their home State. In
and around 1850 this tide of emigration flowed with a
deep and wide current. Among those who left their
homes to find an abiding place in the new State,
marvelous accounts of the fertility and splendor of
which were constantly being carried back to Kentucky,
was Joseph O. Shelby. He was born at Lexington in
1831, and when only nineteen years of age joined in the
great march westward and found a home on the
Missouri River at Berlin, one hundred and fifty miles
west of St. Louis. These Missouri-Kentuckians carried
with them one of the important manufacturies of the
State,—hemp, which for many years was chiefly a
Kentucky product. In the rich, loamy lands of Missouri,
this staple grew with great luxuriousness, and the
introduction of hemp seed from China both improved
the quality and increased the production per acre.
Not only did the fertile land and the salubrious climate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
turn these people westward, but a love of change also
aroused this spirit of emigration.</p>

<p>Young Shelby was fairly well educated. He was a
born leader, and no braver heart ever beat in human
bosom. Warrior blood coursed through his veins. His
grandfather was a brother of Isaac Shelby. This guaranteed
patriotism and valor. He had great dash, a
spirit of unlimited enterprise, willing and ready to work,
with a vigorous body and a brave soul, he became a
Missourian and was an ideal immigrant. He had come
from the very center of hemp manufacture in Kentucky.
This product was made into bagging and bound with
hemp ropes. The cotton country of the South was
largely dependent upon Kentucky and Missouri for
these two things so essential in marketing cotton. It
was a most profitable and remunerative manufacture
and was largely carried on by the use of negro labor.
Modern machinery had not then been invented for the
use of weaving the bagging or of twisting the ropes.
To produce these products so important in cotton
growing, it was necessary to rely upon the crudest
implements.</p>

<p>Sixty miles east of Kansas City, Shelby selected a
location at Waverly, Lafayette County, and there
began his operations as a bagging and rope manufacturer.
It was easy to ship the product down the
Mississippi and from thence to scatter it throughout
the cotton districts by the waterways over Arkansas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Alabama.
Shelby was successful from the very inception of his new
enterprise. He was hardly well settled in his new
home before the difficulties in Kansas began. Strongly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
believing in slavery, his views as well as his interests
and his proximity to the Kansas line intensified his
opinions. Loving adventure, brave in war, he returned
to Kentucky to recruit there for the Kansas imbroglio.
In these days it was not difficult to find in Shelby’s
native State men who loved adventure, who were
always ready for war, and were overjoyed at the chance
to get into a fight. With Clark, Atchison and Greene,
Shelby did his full share in the Kansas fighting. It
gave him experience that was valuable to him a few
years later in the great war. He won reputation with
his Kentucky fighters, and when the truce was patched
up he went back to the peaceful surroundings of his
rope walk in Waverly. This place was noted for its
uncompromising Southern sentiments. The anti-slavery
settlers who went by it, ascending the Missouri
River, always steered away from it. They knew there
was neither comfort to be obtained nor security to be
assured when they passed this point. They could not
buy anything they wanted there, and they were likely
to find trouble.</p>

<p>When the troubles of 1860 began to develop, no one
was more enthusiastic for the South or more willing
to fight for its rights than Joseph O. Shelby. There
was no section, even in Confederate States, more loyal
to the South than the immediate territory about Waverly.
With sentiments fixed and embittered by the
Kansas War, the young men of that portion of Missouri
were not only brave and ambitious, but they were
anxious to go to war. With his prejudices quickened
and enlarged by his nearness to Kansas, which was
even then a bitter State, in so far as slavery was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
concerned, Shelby organized and equipped a company
of cavalry at Waverly. It was easy to fill up its ranks
with enthusiastic, dashing young fellows who were
only too happy in taking the chances of battle, and
they were charmed to find a leader of Shelby’s experience,
of his enthusiasm, and of his intrepidity.</p>

<p>Independence, Missouri, the county seat of Jackson
County, was only twelve miles from Kansas City.
A vast majority of its people were intensely southern,
and when Independence was threatened with the
presence of Federal dragoons, Shelby and his company
lost no time in marching forty miles from Lafayette
County to see that their friends and sympathizers at
Independence had a square deal from the Union
soldiers. It soon was spread abroad that if the dragoons
did come there was trouble ahead and they
stayed away. Shelby, now in for the war, rode to
join Governor Jackson and General Price in defense of
Missouri.</p>

</figure>

<p>In these days it did not take long for fighting men
in Missouri to find people who were willing to fight
them. The southern part of the State was much divided
in political sentiment, and the bitterness of a civil war
found full development in that territory. At the
Battle of Carthage, July 5th, 1861, Shelby and his
men did splendid service, and their excellent discipline,
their superb courage, did a great deal, not only to
create, but to intensify the spirit and steady the arms
of the entire Missouri contingent. Beginning as a captain,
rising to brigadier-general in three years, Shelby
had an activity and experience that few enjoy. He
fought in the Army of the Tennessee, and he fought in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>the Trans-Mississippi Department, and he was never
more delighted than when fighting.</p>

<p>Wilson’s Creek, one of the sanguinary battles of
the war, was fought on the tenth day of August, 1861,
and there Shelby again demonstrated that the only
thing necessary to make a reputation and fame as a
great cavalryman was the opportunity.</p>

<p>General John H. Morgan, in Kentucky, and Shelby
were close friends. They began their careers in much
the same way. Morgan had his company of Kentucky
riflemen: Shelby his company of Missouri cavalrymen.
Morgan died in the struggle: Shelby lived thirty-six
years after the close and died in 1897. These two soldiers
had grown up in Lexington, and while Morgan
was five years Shelby’s senior, they were intimates.
Shelby’s career did not close until May, 1865. At the
end, unwilling to accept the results of the war, he
marched into Mexico with five hundred of his followers
and undertook to found an American colony. This
project soon failed. The wounds of the war began to
heal, and Shelby and his colonists were glad to come
back and live under the flag they had so bravely and
tenaciously fought. No man in the Confederate army
marched more miles, and, with the possible exception
of General Joe Wheeler, fought more battles. His
activities were ceaseless as the seasons, and his capacity
for riding and fighting had no limit. The Trans-Mississippi
Department had more difficulties to face
than any other part of the Confederacy. They were
styled “The Orphans.” They were the step-children
in supplies of provisions and munitions of war, and,
but for the trade in cotton which was arranged through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
Mexico, its conditions would have been difficult and
well-nigh hopeless. Far removed from Richmond, the
seat of the government, it was the scene of jealousies
and disputes as to the rank of officers. Covering a
territory greater than the remainder of the Confederate
States, separated by the Mississippi River from the
armies of the East, assailable by the ocean on the south,
pierced by many navigable streams, with few manufactories,
and with contentions caused by conflicting
claims, it was the theatre of much mismanagement;
but, through all, its soldiers were brave, loyal and
patriotic, and lose nothing in comparison with the
best the Confederacy produced. Considering the
means at hand, the men in Missouri, Arkansas, Texas,
Louisiana and Indian Territory did much to win the
garlands with which fame crowned the brows of those
who immortalized the gray.</p>

<p>In 1862 and the beginning of 1863, when the call
became more urgent from the East, Shelby was among
the Missourians and other soldiers from the Trans-Mississippi
who crossed the Mississippi River. Leaving
their own territory unprotected, these thousands
of Arkansas, Missouri and Texas men cheerfully and
bravely took their lives in their hands and went over
to help their brethren in Mississippi and Tennessee
who stood with hands uplifted, crying, “Come over
and help us.” Shelby, with his company, gladly
crossed the stream. They left their horses behind them
and went to aid Beauregard and Bragg, Hardee, Van
Dorn and Polk, who, with their armies, were so sorely
pressed by the descending avalanche, which, coming
down through Kentucky and Tennessee and along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
Mississippi and up the Tennessee River, was surely
and quietly destroying the life of the Confederacy.
The pressure, in the absence of these men who had
been transferred into Mississippi and Tennessee, became
so tense in Missouri, Arkansas, Texas and Northern
Louisiana, that additional measures were taken to
enlist soldiers who would prevent the occupation of
the western bank of the Mississippi, and among the
men commissioned to raise regiments, Shelby was the
first named. It was not much to do for a man to tell
him that he might raise a regiment when he was a
thousand miles away from anybody he could hope to
enlist. He had a hundred trained, disciplined and gallant
men, and with these, hope made the future
attractive. Difficulties in those days did not discourage
Shelby, and so, taking his one hundred men—whose
terms of enlistment had expired, they found
their way by railway and on foot to the Mississippi
River, at a point opposite Helena, Arkansas. At this
time, that part of the Mississippi River was under
control of the Federals, except Vicksburg and Port
Hudson. It required an unusual man to meet the conditions
that now faced Shelby. He was a wonderful
man, and by January, 1863, he had entered the State
of Missouri, then within the grip of Federal forces,
and almost entirely under Federal control with garrisons
in every center over the State. With fifty thousand
Federal soldiers controlling that Commonwealth, he
passed through all these; he safely evaded the enemies
in the southern part of the State, carrying his one
hundred men for two hundred and seventy-five miles
through territory thoroughly occupied by his enemies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
In a very brief while, he was not only able to get together
a regiment, but a brigade. He was unwilling
to take any more chances on twelve months’ enlistments,
and he swore his recruits in for the war. The
men who had been with him gave him the best possible
credentials among the young men along the Missouri
River. Threatened Federal conscription and persecution
by their foes had made them desperate, and they
were only too glad to find a leader who had come from
Corinth, Mississippi, with fame in battle, to organize
and lead them. It was splendid material, and Shelby’s
success was not only surprising to him but to all the
commanders further south in Arkansas. Such an experience
was an unusual one in the life of any man,
and only one of great resources and iron will could have
succeeded when going into the enemy’s country garrisoned
on every hand and made liable to arrest and even
death, and secure three regiments of a thousand men
each and march them three hundred miles into friendly
territory. Having no arms, except such as they could
find at home, consisting of shotguns and revolvers,
they furnished their own mounts and gladly went
where Shelby asked them to go.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">MAP OF SHELBY’S MISSOURI RAID</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Only a man who had the essential qualities of a
cavalry leader could have won in the face of such
difficulties. Shelby improved every opportunity that
came his way. There were constant jealousies which
opposed his promotion. After he had organized and
disciplined his brigade, it was nearly twelve months
before his commission as brigadier-general came.
This he was to win by his raid into Missouri in September,
1863, but he got it later. Waverly, the most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>northerly point which Shelby was to reach on this
raid, was, as the crow flies, two hundred and seventy-five
miles from the Arkansas line. From Arkadelphia,
where Shelby started, it was two hundred and fifty
miles to the Arkansas line. He had been long teasing
his superiors to let him make a raid. There were many
inducements for him to take the chances of such an
expedition. He felt sure in the first place he could
carry his men in and safely bring them out. He felt
extremely confident that he could enlist a large number
of recruits, and he was not devoid of ambition, so he
longed to demonstrate his power and his capacity as a
leader. He had been a colonel for nearly two years.
He had self-confidence, he had marvelous resources,
and he always won the admiration of his associates.
General Schofield was in command of the department
of Missouri. The State covered an area of sixty
thousand square miles. To defend this, he had fifty
thousand soldiers, and Missouri herself had enlisted
many of these, which, while in the employ of the State,
were subject to Federal jurisdiction.</p>

<p>On the 10th of September, 1863, Little Rock had
been evacuated and a few days later taken possession
of by the Federals. This was a great blow to the men
of the Confederacy. Fort Smith also had fallen, and
these two towns on the Arkansas River gave control
to the Federals of one-half of the State. Through the
White and Arkansas Rivers it opened up means for
transporting men and supplies four hundred miles
south of St. Louis. To Arkansas the loss of the Arkansas
River was what the loss of the Mississippi
River was to the Confederacy. It was yet, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
a great task for the Federals to move supplies from
the White River or the Mississippi River when the
stages of the Arkansas River prevented the passage
of boats along its waters. The loss of Little Rock and
Fort Smith and the shutting off of the Confederate
troops from easy access to Missouri had done much to
depress the spirit of the men who, west of the Mississippi,
were struggling for Southern independence.
For months Shelby had entertained the idea that if he
were but turned loose with one thousand men he could
ride to the banks of the Missouri River, do much damage
to the property of the Federals, and bring out a large
number of recruits. In Missouri the conditions had
rendered it unsafe for men who sympathized with the
South to express their sentiments, and anxious again
to turn his face towards his adopted home and meet
his friends and family, and longing for the glory which
he felt would come to the successful prosecution of
such an expedition, he pleaded with Generals Holmes
and Price and Governor Reynolds and the other officials
in the Trans-Mississippi to give him this permission.
The Confederate authorities looked at the thing more
calmly than the young military enthusiast. He
assured them that recruits would be abundant and that
he could fill up his ranks, dismay his enemies, and inflict
severe loss in every way upon his foes. They felt that
he was taking a tremendous risk to make such an expedition.
Some suggested that he was hot-headed,
that he lacked the experience as well as the poise for so
grave an undertaking. He had been a colonel for
twenty-two months. None could deny that he was
courageous, that he had faith in himself, that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
possessed of unlimited enthusiasm. These were a
splendid equipment for the work he essayed to do.
Shelby’s persistence at last availed, and on September
10th, 1863, consent was given for him to make the
attempt to carry out his plans. He was allowed eight
hundred men, twelve ammunition wagons, and two
pieces of artillery. Only six hundred of his men started
with him from Arkadelphia, two hundred recruits he
was to pick up later further north. Arkadelphia, in
Clark County, Arkansas, was one hundred and fifteen
miles south of Ozark, at which point Shelby had determined
to cross the Arkansas River. From Fort Smith,
as well as from Little Rock, scouting parties had gone
sixty miles south of Ozark, so that in fifty miles from
where Shelby started it was certain he would meet
opposition, and that the Federals would attempt to
thwart his plans. Once permission was given, there was
nothing short of death could stop Shelby’s march.
He had pleaded to go, and no dangers, no opposition,
could deter him from his purpose. It was true that
gloom and doubt had settled in the hearts and minds
of many of the leaders who at that time were gathered
in and about Arkadelphia, but this spirit, either of
hesitation or fear, never touched the soul of Shelby.
The people who permitted Shelby to go had forebodings
of the outcome, and permission was only granted when
it became apparent that nothing would satisfy Shelby
but an opportunity to work out his plans. The limited
number of soldiers allowed him showed that the Confederate
leaders were not willing to risk very much on
his undertaking. Marmaduke, always ready to take
risks, assented, but he gravely doubted the result. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
men who were to go with Shelby were as enthusiastic
as he. It was “Home-going,” it was an opportunity
to try out chances with the militia over in Missouri,
whom Shelby and his men hated with greatest
bitterness. The autumn sun was shining brightly when
Shelby aligned his small force, placed himself at their
head, and waved adieu to Governor Reynolds.
The other troops, watching the departure of these
gallant and dashing raiders, experienced deepest
sorrow when they realized that they were to be left
behind. There was no man among the thousands who
witnessed the going of these brave boys who would not
have willingly taken chances with them. There were
no fears of what the future would bring forth. One
man in every six of those who rode away would not
come back, when at the end of thirty-six days Shelby
would return.</p>

<p>Two hundred men taken each from four regiments
lacked in some respects homogeneity, but all shouted
and waved their hats and guns as the command to
march passed down the line. From that moment they
became brothers with a common purpose and common
courage. The fact of going had by some subtle telepathy,
which always marked cavalrymen, gone out
among the entire brigade, and from that moment there
was universal eagerness to ride with Shelby, and when
the assignments were made and the columns formed
there were two thousand disappointed men who felt
most keenly the dealings of fate which deprived them
of a place in the moving column. If the selection had
been left to Shelby he would most likely have taken
his entire regiment. These had become with him so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
dependable, and between themselves and Shelby
there had grown up not only affection but completest
trust. They believed in him and he believed in them,
and they felt that no emergency could arise and that
he would make no call upon them that was not demanded
by duty. As these six hundred brave men
mounted into their saddles and the column started,
cheer after cheer greeted each company as it passed by.
Governor Reynolds and General Price forgot the
formality of military etiquette, and with those who
went and those who stayed they joined in vociferous
cheers. Benedictions came from every heart as out
into the unknown dangers and experiences of the
expedition these men rode, souls all aglow with patriotism,
joy and soldierly valor. When Shelby held the
hand of Governor Reynolds, the expatriated governor
prayed him to be cautious, begged him to save as far
as possible the lives of the young heroes under him
and to be watchful even unto death. As this kindly
admonition ended the governor pulled the leader
close to him and whispered into his ear, “Joe, if you
get through safely, this will bring you a brigadier-general’s
commission.”</p>

<p>An ugly wound received eighty days before at the
assault upon Helena, July 4th, still gave Shelby intense
suffering. It was unhealed and suppurating.
A minie ball had struck his arm and passed longitudinally
through the part from the elbow down. It was
still bandaged and supported with a sling. With his free
hand he gathered up the reins of his bridle and ignoring
pain and danger, he looked more the hero, as thus
maimed and yet courageous he started on so long a ride<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
and so perilous a campaign. With his great physical
handicap, the admiration was all the more intense,
for the spirit and the grit of the man who was undertaking
one of the most dangerous and difficult expeditions
of the war. Shelby’s body was subordinated to
the beckonings of glory and the splendor of the opportunity
which had now come in obedience to his pleadings
to serve his State, his cause, his country. Other
men, less brave or determined, would have hesitated.
Some men, possibly equally chivalrous, would have
taken a furlough rather than have sought new dangers
and more difficult service.</p>

<p>None of these boys marching away cared to peer
into the future. Along the roads and the paths of the
ride and in the midst of battles they were to fight, one
in six was to find a soldier’s grave, or, struck down by
wounds or disease, might meet death under the most
distressing circumstances at the hands of the bushwhackers
and home guards who then filled the garrisons
of Missouri towns. The joy of home-going eliminated
all thought of misery of the future. These men
were to ride two hundred and twenty-five miles to the
Arkansas State line and two hundred and fifty miles
from the Arkansas State line through Missouri to
Waverly, in all four hundred and seventy-five miles.
The return made nine hundred and fifty miles, even
if they marched by an air line.</p>

<p>A little way out on his journey Shelby met Colonel
David Hunter with a hundred and fifty men, recruits
who were coming out from Missouri to join the Confederates
in Arkansas. Hunter and Shelby were kindred
spirits. The persecution of some of Hunter’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
family had rendered him an intense fighter. He was
considered one of the rising infantry officers, but
cavalry work suited him better, and so he gave up his
rank of colonel with a regiment of infantry in order to
take the chances of recruiting a cavalry command.
Hunter was bringing out with him several hundred
women and children who had been driven from their
Missouri homes. Turning these over to a portion of
his command, he chose the more promising of his
followers and fell into line with Shelby. At Caddo
Gap, on the fourteenth day, it was learned that a company
of Confederate deserters and Union jayhawkers
were in the mountains close by. With a horror and
deepest hatred born of the crimes of these men, outlaws
from both armies, it was resolved that the first
work of the raid should be their extermination. Major
Elliott, commanding one of the battalions under Shelby,
discovered the lair of these men later in the afternoon,
and as soon as it was dark he attacked them with great
vigor. Seventy-nine of them were killed and thirty-four
captured. Their leader was as brave as any
soldier in either army. Puritan blood coursed through
his veins. Condemned to death for his crimes, he was
left with Major Elliott while the remainder of the force
marched forward. The captain of the firing party with
a small squad was left to finish up reckonings of justice
with this bloody robber and murderer. There had
been no court martial. These men were to be killed by
common consent. They had been taken in the act, and
their crimes were known. The captain in charge of the
execution thought it would not be unreasonable to
allow any of those who were to be put to death a brief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
time for prayer. Lifting up his voice, so that all his
captors and executioners could hear, the condemned
captain prayed—“God bless the Union and all its
loyal defenders. Bless the poor ignorant rebels;
bless Mrs. McGinnins and her children; bless the
Constitution which has been so wrongly misinterpreted,
and eradicate slavery from the earth.” The increasing
distance between the command induced the captain to
cry out, “Hurry up, hurry up, old man, the command
has been gone an hour and I will never catch up,” to
which the captain, so soon to die, responded, “I am
ready, and may Heaven have mercy upon your soul.”
The order was given, and the death of twenty old men
who had been murdered by this man in the immediate
neighborhood shortly before, was avenged, in so far as
human law could mete out punishment for horrible
crimes. Both sides hated these outlaws, and Federal
reports are full of similar condign punishment inflicted
upon this class of marauders, who plundered and
killed without the least regard for the laws of God or
man.</p>

<p>When near Roseville, a short distance south of the
Arkansas River, Shelby encountered the 1st Arkansas
Federal Cavalry. In northern Arkansas, by the summer
of 1863, Union generals had been able to induce
enlistments among the residents of that part of the
State, and naturally the feeling between these so-called
renegades and the Missouri and Arkansas Confederates
was extremely bitter, and whenever they faced each
other in battle there was no great desire to hear the
cries or calls of surrender. These Federal Arkansians
and a battalion of the 3rd Illinois Regiment undertook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
to dispute Shelby’s right of way. They were speedily
ridden over and the road cleared of this impediment.
The river was forded near Ozark, and here again Shelby
found some old acquaintances of the 6th Kansas
Cavalry. This regiment had seen much service in
southwest Missouri and northern Arkansas. It had
hunted Shelby and Shelby had hunted it, and neither
avoided an opportunity to measure swords with the
other. Shelby disposed of this new menace in short
order. He had now gotten far up among the mountains,
and he traveled a hundred and forty miles, with
two fights to his credit, and concluded to give his men
one day’s rest.</p>

<p>On the 21st of September, Shelby received authority
to make the expedition, and on the 22nd he promptly
started on this tremendous march of fifteen hundred
miles. Cutting the telegraph wires north of the Arkansas
River, Shelby planned to enter the Boston Mountains,
from which, northwardly, no intelligence of his
coming could be disseminated. It did not take Shelby
long to find Federal forces. Within four days from the
time he left Arkadelphia, he had learned that his
advance would be fiercely contested. His chief concern
was to pass the Arkansas River. He found it
fordable, but treacherous, and by the 29th, seven days
after starting, reached Bentonville, Arkansas. By the
4th of October, Shelby had marched two hundred and
fifty-five miles to Neosho, Missouri, where there were
three hundred Federal cavalry. These were quickly
surrounded and forced to surrender. Their equipment
was tremendously valuable, but their horses were a
real godsend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>So soon as Shelby passed Neosho, his enemies were
fully aware not only of his presence but of his plans.
They argued reasonably that he would seek to reach
his own home at Waverly and that he would not
diverge from a straight line more than twenty or thirty
miles. The Federal forces then in Missouri were concentrated
at points between Neosho and Waverly
over a space twenty or thirty miles wide. By this time,
the passions of the war had been fully aroused. Life
became no longer a certain thing, the law having been
suspended and the southern part of Missouri having
been greatly divided; hates had been aroused, excesses
committed, men killed, families driven from their
homes. McNeil’s disgraceful order for the deportment
of Southern sympathizers from a large portion of the
State had been savagely enforced, and so, on reaching
Bower’s Mills, a place where the militia had been
particularly offensive, the town was sacked and then
burned. Along the route Shelby traveled the next day,
after leaving Bower’s Mills, every house belonging to a
Southern family had been burned and, in many instances,
the inhabitants put to death. On the 7th of
October Shelby captured Warsaw in Benton County,
far up towards the point he was attempting to reach.
Here, too, Federal forces attempted to dispute his
passage of the Osage River. By this time a spirit of
highest enthusiasm had taken deepest hold upon the
men. Nothing could chill their spirits. Soldiers
dashed into and across the river. Neither nature nor
man could stay their progress. At Warsaw vast quantities
of all kinds of stores and supplies, including
horses, had been concentrated and these all fell prey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
to the hungry raiders, and what they could not use
were turned over to the remorseless touch of the flames.</p>

<p>By the 10th of October, Tipton was reached. On
an air line, this left Shelby only fifty miles from Waverly,
to which place, the abode of his dearest friends,
he purposed in his heart to go. From Tipton for thirty
miles in every direction rails were torn up, bridges
destroyed, wires cut, and cattle guards and water tanks
obliterated. When leaving Tipton, Shelby found
opposed to him Colonel T. T. Crittenden, a Kentuckian,
whom Shelby had known in earlier days, and who had
a thousand well-armed and well-drilled mounted men.
Shelby had two reasons for destroying Crittenden:
first, he hated him, because he was a renegade Kentuckian,
according to Shelby’s standard; second, because
he stood across his pathway to Booneville. The
artillery was brought into line with the cavalry, and
Shelby’s whole command, with his artillery in the
center, made a galloping charge at Crittenden’s regiment.
The Federal regiment melted away, leaving
the killed and wounded behind and a few prisoners as
hostages.</p>

<p>Booneville, on the south side of the Missouri River,
had been a place from which many expeditions had
been sent out and from which many orders had been
issued for the persecution of the Southern people. The
town authorities, pleading for mercy, gladly surrendered.
It looked as if Shelby had disregarded all
prudence and brought himself into a trap from which
it would be impossible for him to escape.</p>

<p>Hardly had Booneville been passed when General
Brown, a Federal commander, with four thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
men, came up. Brown was a vigilant general, an
impetuous fighter and a soldier of both renown and
courage. He was not afraid of Shelby. In this respect
he was better off than some of his associates. Game,
ambitious and enterprising, he thought it would be a
splendid stroke to bag Shelby in his territory and take
him a prisoner to Jefferson City—Missouri’s capital.
To accomplish these ends, he carefully laid his plans
and bent his utmost energies. He well understood
this meant real fighting. He lost no time in assailing
Shelby’s pickets. He resolved to push his foes at
every point, and fight whenever he could find a
Confederate.</p>

<p>Shelby had broken an axle of his rifled gun. This
he felt would be extremely useful to him later on. He
ordered Colonel Hunter to hold the enemy in check
until he made the necessary repairs on his cannon.
By ten o’clock at night, stores had been removed
and the gun repaired. The night before had been one
of a great downpour of rain. This prevented much
sleep. Shelby, not unmindful of the tremendous work
that was immediately before him, determined to give his
troopers a night’s rest, so that they might be better
prepared for the strenuous experiences that the morrow
and the next three days had in store for them. General
Brown was fiercely persistent and assailed Shelby’s rear
furiously and incessantly. The Federal authorities
were clamoring for Shelby’s destruction or his capture.
At the crossing of the Lamine River, Shelby ambushed
the Federals and inflicted serious loss and routed the
assailants; but only momentarily, and then they
came back more savagely. To reach Waverly, it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
necessary to pass through Marshall, and, as Shelby
approached that place, he found four thousand more
Federal soldiers under General Ewing, drawn up ready
for the gage of battle. With Brown in the rear and
Ewing in the front, it looked gloomy for the Confederates.
Shelby was now five hundred miles from
any real hope of succor. General Sterling Price and
Governor Reynolds at Arkadelphia, Arkansas, however
much they might desire to help the dashing raider,
could do naught for his rescue. A few scattered companies
far down in Missouri had neither the will nor the
chance to help him. He was four hundred miles inside
the enemy’s lines, and these enemies were hunting him
with extremest vigor. His capture meant fame for
the captor, and his destruction meant temporary peace
in war-torn Missouri. Every available man was being
thrown across Shelby’s pathway, and every possible
obstacle put along the road he was of necessity compelled
to travel. His march from Marshall and Waverly,
from a military standpoint, was both audacious
and reckless, and appeared to be the act of a man
trifling with fate. To his enemies, it seemed that
Shelby’s impetuosity and the longing for home-going
had destroyed all sense of safety, and they were congratulating
themselves that he had gone into places
from which escape was impossible. Measured by the
ordinary standards of military prudence and foresight,
Shelby had pursued a most unwise course, and the
omens were bad for him and his small brigade. Shelby
conceived the idea of destroying Ewing before Brown
could come up in his rear, and then take his chances
with Brown, and so, with his twelve hundred cavalry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
he attacked four thousand infantry. In a short while
Ewing had been roughly handled, and his rout was
inevitable. Fate seemed propitious, and hope rose
high in Shelby’s breast. The battle with Ewing was
almost won, and with him out of the way, with shouts
of victory on their lips, Shelby would, he believed,
make short work of Brown. An evil destiny now intervened.
Brown had overwhelmed Shanks’ two hundred
and fifty men left to delay his crossing the Lamine
River, and he had rushed on to help Ewing at the
moment when Shelby’s genius and vigorous attack had
nearly completed victory. Shelby needed no interpreter
to tell him that; the firing in his rear demonstrated
that he had miscalculated the rate of Brown’s
approach and that six pieces of artillery and four
thousand fresh troops were upon him.</p>

<p>In such an emergency there was only one course
left open and that was to retreat. Shelby had left a
valiant lieutenant to dispute the crossing of the Lamine
River with Brown, and to hold him while he whipped
Ewing. Well did this gallant soldier, Colonel Shanks,
perform this task. He stood the test as only a brave
man could, but the storm he faced was more than any
two hundred and fifty men could withstand. There
was nothing left for Shelby but to cut his way through
the lines of Ewing. This was a dangerous undertaking.
Even to so brave a man as Shelby, it was a hazardous
task. He looked and saw a weak place in the Federal
line. Only instantaneous action could save him. A
Federal regiment stationed in a corn field with skirmishers
well to the front, and safely ensconced behind
corn shocks, seemed to be the best chance for a hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
drive and successful onslaught. He was too far from
his base to give up his ammunition. He hated to
abandon his meagre supply of cannon. If he stood still
between the two advancing Federal armies of four
thousand men each, annihilation or surrender was the
only fate that could befall him and his men, however
brave they might be. The flash of the eye and the
resolve of a practiced warrior decided the course he
would follow. Escape he would or die in the attempt.
Widening the front of regiments and placing a rider on
each horse of the ammunition wagons and artillery, he
dashed furiously at the Federal forces. The Federals
met the shock with courage and stout resistance, but
the fierce riding Confederates were too much: they
yielded sufficiently to allow Shelby to pass through
with his wagons and his cannon. Hunter’s regiment,
becoming entangled in the thick woods, did not keep
well closed in, and the Federals rallied and cut off
Hunter while Shelby rode triumphantly away. Hunter,
true to the necessities of the occasion, turned squarely
to the right and galloped through another part of the
Federal line and made his escape. Shelby’s force was
now divided, but it had left the enemy behind. It was
impossible for any troops to out-march them. Shelby,
hoping against hope, waited two hours for his separated
forces to join him. Prudence told him longer waiting
meant destruction, and he retreated to Waverly. For
eight miles the Federals pressed his rear with relentless
zeal. By three o’clock in the morning Shelby passed
through his home town. The desire of his heart was
gratified. A few moments were spent in greeting, and
now he was ready to find his own again, and so, turning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
squarely south, he started on his long and ever-lengthening
march to the place from whence he had come.</p>

<p>A little way from Waverly, at Hawkins’ Mills,
Shelby concluded that his wagons and his artillery
would be troublesome, and so he sunk them in the
Missouri River and reduced everything to the lightest
possible weight. It was of the highest importance that
he should safely pass the Osage River. It was a long
march from Waverly to this river. Sleep and rest
were out of the question. The tired beasts were
allowed to feed a little and the men took an hour or two
for repose. Even an hour’s delay might bring disaster.
Nature pleaded for repose and rest, but safety pointed
her finger forward, and fate, willing to extricate the
bold horseman, bade him stay not his hand nor speed.
Leaving Waverly, on the morning of the 14th, to the
evening of the 16th, he had marched more than one
hundred miles. He had gone through from the Missouri
to the Osage River in two days. This was a tremendous
spurt. Nothing now, short of bad management, could
prevent Shelby’s escape, and so he began to move
somewhat more leisurely. Along by the road at Warrensville,
there were two thousand Federals waiting to
hold him up; but he passed a few miles west without
alarming them, and proceeded on to Johnson County,
to which point they pursued him. One of the Federal
commanders reported that Shelby’s men were “running
like wild hogs,” and another, that, bareheaded and
demoralized, they were making their escape in detached
parties through the woods, thickets and byways.
Even though hard pressed, and with no time to spare,
Shelby could not refrain from one effort to punish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
those who had so vigorously and so sorely pressed upon
him. He ordered a dash at his foes, and they, quickly
realizing that it was not wise to press Shelby, even if he
was running, fled at his coming. On the 17th, 18th and
19th of October, men and horses were put to the utmost
limit. The Federals were loth to permit Shelby’s
escape, and they hung on to the Confederate rear with
the grip of death. With such odds in their favor, they
held it a great misfortune to let him get away, and they
judged that all sorts of inquiries and criticisms would
follow, if, with fifty thousand Federal soldiers in Missouri,
even so resourceful and dashing a cavalryman as
Shelby could march nearly through the entire State in
the face of so many pursuers, and then safely ride away.
Energies were redoubled, orders of concentration kept
the wires warm; but warm wires, circulating orders
and relentless pursuit could not stop the mad speed and
the ceaseless tramp of Shelby and his men. They had
better reason to urge them escape than those who were
following had to run them down. On the 20th of
October, he was safely on the Little Osage River in
Arkansas, and there, to Shelby’s gratification and surprise,
he found the remainder of his command under
Colonels Hunter, Hooper and Shanks. Reunited,
their spirits rose to the highest pitch of enthusiasm.
They had been battered and hammered and pursued,
but they were all safe. One hundred and fifty of the
eight hundred men who started were either wounded
or dead along the line of march; but the expedition
was completed, and the apparently impossible was
accomplished.</p>

<p>Fate dealt more generously with Hunter and Hooper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
and Shanks than with Shelby. At Florence and Humansville
and Duroc, on the Osage, they had had their
troubles with the First Arkansas cavalry. They had a
fight with McNeil’s two thousand men at Humansville,
but he was held in check. The Federal forces
were fierce in their attacks, and they marched with the
greatest strenuosity to block the way these men were
taking to avoid capture. Artillery with cavalry in a
forced march is never a thing to be desired. Guns and
caissons make heavy pulling, and no horses can for
many miles keep pace with horsemen who are pushed
to their highest speed. The help of the cannon had
now lost much of its value and as it might retard the
speed in some slight degree, it was destroyed and abandoned
and the last of Shelby’s battery went down before
the aggressive pursuers. It was abandoned at
Humansville, and the fleeing horsemen were glad to
get rid of such a grievous burden.</p>

<p>The greatest sufferers on the tremendous march
had been the horses. They were goaded, tired and
driven to the greatest effort. Half starved, with reduced
flesh, their speed was ever-decreasing. Mercy
was so incessant and so insistent in her appeals that
the beasts were given three days’ rest. Not a single
soldier was willing to scout except when absolutely
necessary to keep in touch with the movements of the
enemy. The Federals, under John Cloud, hearing that
Shelby had escaped from Missouri, left Fayetteville
and went out to hunt him, but Cloud was not very
anxious to find Shelby. He followed slowly and at a
safe distance and pursued Shelby to Clarksville on the
Arkansas River where Shelby crossed the stream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
twelve miles east of Ozark, where he had passed thirty
days before.</p>

<p>A great march was ended, and Shelby, in his reports,
claimed that he had in the thirty days killed
and wounded six hundred Federals; he had taken and
paroled as many more; he had captured and destroyed
ten forts, about eight hundred thousand dollars’
worth of property and he had captured six hundred
rifles, forty stand of colors, three hundred wagons, six
thousand horses and mules, and destroyed a million
dollars’ worth of supplies. At one place in Arkansas
he had dispersed eight hundred recruits and destroyed
fifty thousand dollars’ worth of ordnance. At the time
Shelby left Arkadelphia, Rosecrans was calling for
help, and one day after Shelby started, the Battle of
Chickamauga had been finished and Rosecrans, with
his army driven back and discouraged, was at Chattanooga,
crying for help. Ten thousand men were
kept from reinforcing Rosecrans. All this was accomplished
by eight hundred men. Shelby’s superiors
had led him to believe that this was a forlorn hope.
The young Confederate colonel had shown them they
were mistaken in their estimate of him and that he was
worthy of the wreath on his collar which would make
him a brigadier-general.</p>

<span class="smcap">BATTLE AND CAPTURE OF HARTSVILLE<br>
BY GENERAL JOHN H. MORGAN,<br>
DECEMBER 7th, 1863</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">In October, 1862, General Braxton Bragg, after the
campaign in Kentucky, had brought his army out
by Cumberland Gap, and, resting a brief while in
East Tennessee, moved his forces to Murfreesboro,
thirty miles southeast of Nashville. During General
Bragg’s absence on his Kentucky campaign, the Federals
had a large garrison at Nashville. General John C.
Breckinridge, too late to enter Kentucky, with General
Bragg, had been stationed at Murfreesboro with a
small Confederate force to watch and hold this Nashville
Federal contingent in check. By the 12th of
November, General Bragg had brought his soldiers
through from Knoxville to Murfreesboro. It then
became apparent that somewhere in and around Murfreesboro,
or between that place and Nashville, a
decisive battle would be fought. The Nashville
garrison, reinforced by the return of General Buell’s
army, would be ready for aggressive warfare south of
that city, and as Bragg’s army now intervened between
these Federals and their advance southward, it
required no wise military student to predict that a
great struggle would soon be on. At that time few
understood how great that struggle would be, or that
when it was ended and the losses counted, it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
rank as amongst the most sanguinary battles of the war,
with a loss of two hundred and sixty men per thousand,
making it, in ratio of losses, according to reports, the
second bloodiest field of the Civil War. Forty days
later this expected conflict took place at Murfreesboro
in the Valley of Stone River.</p>

<p>Perryville, Kentucky, where, on the 8th of October,
1862, a battle had raged with such fierceness, had also
proved a memorable conflict to the men of the Army of
the Tennessee. There the Confederate loss was three
thousand, two hundred and twelve, the Federal loss
four thousand, two hundred and forty-one. For the
number of men engaged, in proportion to the time the
battle lasted, it stands in the very forefront of mortalities.
General McCook, of the Federal Army,
referring to it, said: “It is the bloodiest battle of modern
times for the number of troops engaged on our side.”
On the Confederate side one hundred and ninety-six
in every thousand were killed or wounded.</p>

<p>On the 20th of November, 1862, the army of Tennessee
was organized with General Braxton Bragg as
commander. The three army corps were officered
respectively by Generals E. Kirby Smith, Leonidas
Polk and William J. Hardee. General Don Carlos
Buell, on the Federal side, on October 30th, 1862, had
been relieved, and General W. S. Rosecrans had been
put in his place.</p>

<p>At this period of the history of the war in Tennessee,
Sumner County, of which Gallatin was the county
seat, was one of the richest and most productive of the
agricultural districts of the State. Gallatin was thirty-five
miles from Nashville, northeast. Sumner County<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
adjoined Davidson County, of which Nashville was
the county seat. East of Gallatin, some fifteen miles,
was Hartsville, a small town, now the capital of Trousdale
County, one and one-half miles north of the
Cumberland River. Lebanon, Tennessee, the county
seat of Wilson County, was due east of Nashville. A
line drawn from Murfreesboro a little east of north
would pass through Hartsville a distance of thirty-eight
miles. Bragg’s army extended from Murfreesboro
in the direction of Lebanon. A portion of his
infantry was at Baird’s Mills, a village twenty miles
away. Castalian Springs was between Gallatin and
Hartsville, nine miles from Hartsville and six miles
from Gallatin. At Castalian Springs, the Federals,
under John M. Harlan, had a force numbering six
thousand men. At Hartsville was Dumont’s Brigade,
the 39th in the Army of the Cumberland, consisting
of two thousand one hundred men.</p>

<p>General Morgan always maintained a very warm
love of Sumner County. Some of the happiest hours
of his military life were passed there. He was ever
glad of an opportunity to return to Gallatin. Quite a
number of his followers were residents of the county.
His opportunities for scouting and getting information
in that section were most excellent. He learned that
the Federals had about thirteen hundred troops at
Hartsville, and he calculated that their capture was
not only possible, but easy, by a bold, quick dash.
On August 17th, 1862, he had captured Gallatin, and
with it two hundred prisoners, including Colonel Boone
and the other commanding officers of the 28th Kentucky
Federal Regiment. He had another remarkable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
experience there, of which he wrote: “... thus
ended an action in which my command, not exceeding
seven hundred men (one whole company being in the
rear with prisoners), succeeded in defeating a brigade
of twelve hundred chosen cavalry sent by General
Buell to take me or drive me out of Tennessee, killing
and wounding some one hundred and eighty and taking
two hundred prisoners, including the brigadier-general
commanding and most of the regimental officers.”</p>

<p>The Federal generals were justified in the belief
that it was unreasonable for the Confederate troops to
march northward from Murfreesboro to Hartsville
when there was a full garrison at Nashville, as such a
force would be exposed to a flank and rear attack from
that place. John H. Morgan, though not yet having
a commission of brigadier-general, was in command of a
brigade composed of five regiments and two battalions.
He conferred with General Bragg and mapped out a
plan by which he assured General Bragg that with a
force of cavalry and infantry not exceeding eighteen
hundred men, it was practicable to cross the Cumberland
River, attack Hartsville and capture it before the
Federal Army at Castalian Springs, which was three
times as strong as the force Morgan proposed to take
with him, could reach Hartsville and succor the garrison
there. After some discussion and prolonged consideration
General Morgan’s enthusiasm overcame
not only the fears but the objections of the Confederate
commander, who did not fully appreciate the rapidity
of cavalry movements under leaders like Forrest,
Morgan and Wheeler. General Morgan devised the
plan and assumed the responsibility for its success.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
He was willing to stake his reputation and risk his life
on the outcome. He requested permission to select
the force which should accompany him, and for the
infantry he chose the 2nd and 9th Kentucky. These
were part of what was known as the “Orphan Brigade,”
at that time under command of General Roger W.
Hanson, who twenty-four days later, was to die from
wounds received on the battlefield of Murfreesboro,
where, with his last breath, he pathetically exclaimed,
“It is sweet and pleasant to die for one’s country.”
Colonel Thomas H. Hunt, who had made a splendid
reputation for his regiment at Shiloh, Corinth and Baton
Rouge, was designated commander of the infantry.
The 2nd Kentucky, under Major James W. Hewett, on
this occasion carried into battle three hundred and
seventy-five men, and Captain James T. Morehead
led the 9th Kentucky with three hundred and twenty
men, making the infantry all told six hundred and
ninety-five men. The cavalry consisted of Gano’s,
the 3rd Kentucky, Bennett’s, the 9th Tennessee, and
Cluke’s, the 8th Kentucky, and part of Chenault’s,
the 11th. Together they counted close to fifteen
hundred. Two Ellsworth rifled guns and two brass
howitzers comprised the artillery outfit.</p>

<p>At Hartsville was stationed the 104th Illinois
infantry, the 2nd Indiana cavalry, the 12th Indiana
battery, Company E of the 11th Kentucky cavalry,
and the 106th and 108th Ohio infantry. The brigade
was commanded by Captain Absalom B. Moore, of
the 10th Illinois, who had come to Hartsville on the
2nd of December to relieve his predecessor, Colonel
Scott, of the 19th Illinois.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>General Hanson’s brigade, from which parts of the
two Confederate regiments had been taken, was then
at Baird’s Mills, twenty-three miles from Hartsville.</p>

<p>Prior to this time the infantry and cavalry which
composed this expedition had not seen much of each
other. At Baird’s Mills, on December 6th, for the
first time, they came in real contact. The infantry
looked a little askant at the cavalry. None of the horsemen
going with the infantry had seen very extended
service. Cluke’s, Chenault’s and Gano’s regiments
and Stoner’s battalion were new and had been largely
recruited in August and September in Kentucky, and
Bennett’s regiment was not much better, but it was
worse off so far as discipline was concerned. Early
in the morning of December 6th, the cavalry regiments
were marched to Baird’s Mills, arriving there at
eleven o’clock. There was a macadam road from Lebanon
to Hartsville. The ground was covered with snow,
and the temperature was low. It was not a good day
for infantry to march, and it was not favorable weather
for cavalry to ride. At eleven o’clock these organizations,
after a short rest, began the march out of Lebanon
for Hartsville. The cavalry rode in the van with celerity,
but it required three hours for the infantry to cover
the eleven miles to Lebanon. By way of encouragement
to the infantry, they were told that an arrangement
had been made by which with the “ride and tie”
system, they would be mounted half the way. Under
this method the cavalry would ride five or six miles
forward and leave their horses and then march five or
six miles on foot. In the meantime, the infantry
would come up on foot and mount the cavalry horses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
and then ride forward several miles and leave the
horses to await the coming of their owners. Theoretically
this seemed a reasonable proposition. At least it
looked fair. A short distance from Lebanon the infantry
felt the time had come for them to change their
method of transportation. They had patiently trudged
along through the wet snow, and they were sure if they
could get out of the slush that the tread of the infantry
and the wheels of the artillery and the tramp of the
horses had created, they would be happier—at least
more contented. The swap was made. The shoes of
the infantry were thoroughly soaked and the freezing
cold after they were mounted, benumbed their limbs.
This was particularly hard on their wet feet. Unaccustomed
to the methods of cavalry, they did not know how
to keep warm, and in a little while they declared they
would rather walk. The cavalry had gotten their feet
wet while they were playing the infantry act, and slipping
and sliding in the slushy material which covered
the pike, they were glad to remount, but the same
biting cold which so severely punished the infantry
seriously troubled them. To make matters worse,
the horses got mixed, and this set their owners to cursing
and abusing everybody connected with the expedition.
The cavalry cussed the infantry, and the infantry
cussed the cavalry, and between them they cussed
everybody they knew anything about. The situation
was so extremely ridiculous that after awhile everybody
lapsed into good humor. It was a gloomy opening for
so glorious a campaign. Nature, unpropitious, appeared
implacable, but the purpose and plans of the expedition
soon leaked out and the entire command became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
at once enthused with the prospect of a fight and victory.
In a brief while, with all the discomforts which
surrounded them, the horsemen and the “footmen”
made up, jollied each other, and swore they were glad
they had come. They were assured that with Morgan,
Hunt, Duke, Chenault, Cluke, Gano, Bennett and
Stoner as their leaders, something really great was
about to be achieved, and triumph, glory and renown
were in their grasp.</p>

<p>General Morgan had calculated to assault at daylight.
He estimated that his fighting force would be
considerably larger than that of the enemy he was to
attack and attempt their capture, and as they might
be intrenched, he must not only take advantage of
strategy, but also of the opportunities which would
come from sudden and vigorous onslaught in the dark
upon unprepared soldiers.</p>

<p>In marching the artillerymen had much the best
of it, but when the fighting began they got much the
worst of it. The drivers were riding, and the gunners,
perched on the caissons, were removed from all contact
with the slush, and by rubbing and stamping they
kept their feet and hands warm enough to prevent them
from getting down to walk. They looked with complacency
upon their less fortunate fellows who were
trudging the pike.</p>

<p>The Cumberland River in this locality was the
dividing line between the Federal and Confederate
territory. General Morgan, through his scouts, had
managed to procure a few small leaky flatboats at
Puryear’s Ferry, several miles below Hartsville.
Around ten o’clock at night the advance guard and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
artillery reached the river. The infantry, beginning
their marching at eleven o’clock in the morning, now,
after eleven hours, had covered seventeen miles. They
could almost see the lights of the camp fires at
Hartsville.</p>

<p>From the time of the reconnaissance of Morgan’s
scouts, the Cumberland River had made a material
rise, and to put across the artillery between ten o’clock
and three o’clock, five hours, with the inadequate
equipment, was no light task. General Morgan was in
immediate command of the infantry and artillery, and
Colonel Basil W. Duke in charge of the cavalry. There
was of necessity a great rush to get over the river in
order to enable the infantry to march five miles quickly
enough to strike Hartsville at daybreak, and every
energy was bent to accomplish this herculean task.
Finally this was safely accomplished and the infantry
and artillery, full of hope, and though naturally wearied
from a long, difficult march of over twenty-one miles,
were inspired to new efforts when they realized that
only a short distance away was the game in search of
which they had come, and for the bagging of which
they were undergoing such severe physical punishment.</p>

<p>After recovering their horses as far as possible, the
cavalry left the pike and marched through the country
to a ford several miles below the ferry, where the infantry
and artillery had been put over. Haste and
complete co-operation were equally essential in the
successful issue of this perilous undertaking. Generals
Morgan and Duke had calculated that the stream
would be fordable, but fate again seemed to intervene
to protect the Federals, quietly sleeping in their tents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
on the heights about Hartsville. The darkness, the
severe cold, the rapid currents and the leaky, inferior
boats, the difficult landings and still more difficult
fords, all combined to try out the courage and metal
of the men now going upon one of the most hazardous
enterprises of the war. These obstacles did not shake
the determination of General Morgan or the patience
or courage of his men. They had come to win glory
and punish their enemies. Prudence may have suggested
to turn back. Morgan, believing in his destiny
and relying upon the valor of his followers, resolved to
go on and succeed or meet direful defeat.</p>

<p>In this perplexing and uncertain hour, General
Morgan measured up to the highest standard of a
great cavalry leader. Calm, fearless, confident, undaunted,
he supervised the troublesome crossing.
With Colonel Hunt of the infantry he appeared to be
everywhere. His valiant spirit chafed at the unavoidable
delays, but a kindly word of encouragement to
his toiling, tired and half-frozen men warmed their
blood into a new glow and gave them quickened action
and expanded hope. The leader’s indomitable will
stilled every doubt or fear and made every man in the
ranks an invincible hero. The darkness, relieved only
by a few flickering torches, made ghastly shadows on
the muddy, sloppy banks. Pickets, hastily sent in the
piercing cold, were in the silence watching for any foes
who should be skulking at these unseemly hours in
search of enterprising enemies, and they could hear in
the Federal camps the commands spoken in relieving
guards who were unconscious of the presence of Confederate
legions which at earliest dawn were preparing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
to swoop down upon them with defeat and capture,
and who by the rising of the morrow’s sun would bring
death and wounds to many and captivity to all the
sleeping hosts for whose defense and protection they
were, with ceaseless tread, pacing the frozen and snow-clad
earth.</p>

<p>By reason of recent rains further up the river, its
currents were increased and quickened, and when the
advance guard of the cavalrymen undertook to cross
the river at the appointed ferry, to their dismay they
discovered it was impassable at that point. Nothing
daunted, however, by this unlooked-for obstacle,
General Duke learned that there was a ford farther
down the stream, where it was likely he could get his
men and horses across, and rapidly and silently the
cavalry trotted through the fields to the new ford.
When this was reached it also presented most serious
difficulties. It was an unused crossing, and it was
impossible to get to the river except by a crooked
bridle path along which the men could proceed only
in single file. When the river was reached, it was
found that the descent into the water was almost
impossible. It was necessary to spur the horses into
the stream over a bank several feet high. As a result,
both men and horses were submerged in the water,
and with the thermometer low in the scale, in the night
time, and in the gloom of the darkness preceding the
break of day, such a bath would have a fearfully chilling
effect upon the ardor of any patriot. With several
hundred horses tramping over the narrow path which
led to the bank of the stream, the slush was churned
deeper and deeper. Wet to the skin, with their clothes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
muddy and dripping, with their saddles, blankets and
saddle pockets in the same condition, as these horsemen
emerged from the stream on the north side, they found
equal difficulties there. The ascent was steep and slippery
and the pathway rough, and the shivering mounts
with difficulty bore their riders to the open land.</p>

<p>Even the horses, with the vision of the misfortunes
to their fellows ahead, were reluctant to make the plunge
down into the river. The brutes saw the sad plight of
those who were just in front, and watching them struggling
in the water, they hesitated to follow in such difficult
role. Spurring, pushing, driving, belaboring
drove them one by one into the stream. The soldiers,
shaking with cold, almost wished they were back by
their happy firesides in central Kentucky, but they
were game enough for any contingency war might
develop, and as the leaders rode into the stream none
hesitated, but all took the plunge. Those who were first
over managed to build a few fires by which they might
create some heat for their soaked and shivering bodies.
So depressing was the temperature of the water and
so great the strain on the nervous system that, after
the plunge, quite a number of the command became
so benumbed as to be unable to go forward. Notwithstanding
the untiring efforts of General Duke, aided
by the regimental officers, it was found impossible to
get all the command over in time to enable the approach
to Hartsville by daybreak. With part of the cavalry
on one side and part on the other, General Duke, who
was always prompt, at four o’clock in the morning took
such men as had already passed the stream, consisting
of Cluke’s, Chenault’s and Bennett’s regiments, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
rode with accelerating haste to the appointed meeting
place, a mile and a half from the camp of the enemy.
He picketed the line of march from the ford to the
junction point so that no Federal forces could prevent
the remainder of the column which had been left
behind from reaching those who had gone before.
Six miles was between him and the spot where he had
agreed to meet General Morgan, and after this union
they would still be nearly three miles from Hartsville.
The infantry was over, the artillery was over, and three-fifths
of the cavalry, and when these were united,
General Morgan decided that he could wait no more
for the other regiment (Gano’s), but must take his
chances with what men he had and rush the enemy.
He knew full well it would not take long for the Federals
to march double quick from Castalian Springs to
Hartsville. This could be done under stress in two and
a half hours, and when this force should reach Hartsville,
General Morgan understood he would have an
enemy in his rear three times as strong as his fighting
men, and a body in front largely outnumbering the men
he proposed carrying into the engagement. This was
a period of tremendous physical and mental strain. It
required supreme courage and unfailing nerve to enable
even the greatest of leaders to calmly face such an
emergency. The seven hundred infantry were now
shut in by the river, which a short while before under
great difficulties they had passed. If Colonel Harlan
at Castalian Springs and the Hartsville garrison
should unite, even the courage of the “Orphan Brigade”
would be severely tested to face such tremendous odds.
In a crisis, the cavalry might scatter and ride away, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
the infantry would have no chance of crossing the
Cumberland, or marching through the country on foot.
Victory, and victory quick, was the only solution of
the grave problems of the hour. Boldness, promptness,
intrepidity, desperate courage might save the situation,
and it was not without serious, but silent misgivings
that General Morgan ordered the command forward.
In his calm and unruffled countenance, in his self-possessed
and undisturbed demeanor, none could detect
the conflict and struggle that was filling his mind and
heart. There were no preliminaries that required a
moment’s delay. Instant and fierce fighting might
win. Hesitation or doubt would bring certain disaster.
In the silence and gloom of the night, led by the guides,
familiar with every foot of the way, those who walked
and those who rode pressed on to find the sleeping foe.
Few commands were necessary. The column covered
more than a mile, but the horsemen in front followed
hard upon the guides, and the infantry with quickened
steps, kept a pace that left no intervals between the
mounted men who in the vanguard held the place of
danger and honor.</p>

<p>As the day was breaking, the cavalrymen in advance
struck a strong picket force half a mile south of the
Federal camp. The outpost fired and retreated.
This awakened the sleeping Federals. Aroused, they
immediately got ready to receive these early, unwelcome
morning callers. General Morgan had not expected to
capture the pickets. He hoped the cavalry would capture
most of the camp, ride down the sentinels, and the
infantry coming up would thoroughly finish what the
cavalry had begun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>In the incredibly short space of time that intervened
between the attack and the real fight, the surprised
Federals formed a line of battle. They had been
taken unawares, but they were not disposed to run away
without a conflict. They were on an elevation which
slightly raised them above the surrounding fields
through which the Confederates must approach.
The report brought to Morgan made the numbers of the
Federals at Hartsville somewhere around thirteen hundred,
but through the dim light of the morning, when
he saw twenty-one hundred men instead of thirteen
hundred spring into line, immediately it was suggested
to his mind that maybe it might have been wiser for
him to have remained on the south side of the Cumberland.
As they rode into the line of battle, Colonel Duke
casually remarked to General Morgan that he had
gotten more than he had bargained for, to which
Morgan quickly replied, “We must whip and catch
these fellows and cross the river in two hours and a
half or we will have three thousand men on our backs.”
Then he did not know how greatly the army under
Harlan outnumbered the little force with him, which
his faith in them and in himself had led him to venture
into such perilous surroundings. Had he known all
he might even have hesitated and he would surely
more strenuously have hastened the destroying hands
of his followers in burning and wrecking the stores he
had captured. If the men at Hartsville could hold off
the attack a sufficient length of time to enable the men
from Castalian Springs to reach the scene the seven
hundred infantry and six hundred cavalry in line would
make the issue very uncertain. At that time, General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
Morgan did not have more than twelve hundred men
with which to go after the enemy. Brave, defiant and
hopeful, he had sent Bennett’s regiment into the town
to prevent the escape of the Federals. It really looked
for a moment as if nobody would have to look after the
escape of the Federals, but that Morgan would have to
look sharply after his own escape. The Federal officers
could hardly believe that so small a Confederate force
would dare approach the position they were now
attacking, and the audacity of Morgan’s movement
created the impression of a very large force, and this
did much to demoralize the Federal garrison. In
sight of each other the two opposing armies formed
their lines. The Federal force was composed of nearly
all infantry. They had only a small number of cavalry.
The lines were formed about twelve hundred feet apart,
and the skirmishers from these two armies filled the
intervening space and promptly opened a spasmodic
fusillade.</p>

<p>Cluke’s and Chenault’s men, riding swiftly upon
the scene, instantly dismounted and gallantly sprang
into the fight. Although they only numbered four
hundred and fifty men, they looked like several thousand
to the affrighted Federals who, rushing out of the
tents, were not in a frame of mind to calculate with
mathematical exactness the number of those who,
intent on conflict, were rapidly and fearlessly rushing
into their camp. The skirmishers at once became busy
and annoying, but Cluke and Chenault double-quicked
within three hundred feet of where the Federal skirmishers
were. The Federals fired a volley and then
retreated, but the dismounted cavalry rushed on as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
nothing had happened. One hundred and eighty feet
away another volley was fired, and still Cluke and Chenault
were advancing. As Cluke and Chenault got
within close quarters the 104th Illinois infantry fired
at short range. They attempted to back and reload their
guns, but a second volley from the dismounted cavalry
caused them to break in great disorder. Within thirty
minutes of the time Cluke’s and Chenault’s men began
to fire, they had cleared their front of any organized
resistance. In the meantime the enemy’s artillery
was hammering away at Cobb’s two pieces. He had
only two caissons, but one of these was blown up by an
exploding shell from the enemy and his battery had
suffered a loss of more than twenty per cent of its
members. The Federal artillery was handled bravely
and skillfully and inflicted severe damage upon Cobb’s
men and caissons.</p>

<p>The infantry had marched twenty miles over snow-covered,
slushy roads, along every step of which
incisive cold had partially benumbed their limbs.
The warm work of battle gave them new physical
energies. As the 2nd Kentucky dashed across the space
that separated them from the Federals, somebody
unfortunately gave the order to “Halt and dress.”
The enemy had been driven back before the impetuous
charge of the cavalry, and the infantry lost no time in
finishing the brave work of the horsemen. With
victory just within their grasp, there was no need for
“dressing.” A number of officers sprang to the front
and countermanded the order, and Captain Joyce,
seizing the colors, waved them in the dim light of the
early morning and bade the men to follow where he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
would lead. At this juncture a concentrated fire of the
Federals resulted in great loss to the 2nd Kentucky
Infantry. For an instant the line swerved uncertainly,
and then this regiment with eager, resistless fury,
rushed to the conflict again. The 9th Kentucky infantry
now wheeled into action. Stirred with the battle
sounds, they pressed upon their foes like lions released
from their cages. Fortunately, at the critical moment,
one hundred of Gano’s regiment, which had later crossed
the Cumberland River, precipitated themselves into
the conflict. Their coming was timely. Their shouts
and reckless charge added new terrors to the already
disturbed garrison. The Federals, with the Confederates
in the front and on their flank, were driven
into a narrow space and suffered severely from the
pitiless and well-directed fire of the men in gray. The
incessant thud of the minie balls told the story of the
havoc. It appeared to the affrighted Federals that
there was no hope of escape. In seventy-five minutes
from the time the opening shot had been fired the white
flag was run up. The Federal garrison had surrendered,
and the first act of the drama had been finished.</p>

<p>For the length of time the Confederates were
engaged the losses were large. The 9th Infantry lost
seventeen men, the 2nd lost sixty-eight, the 11th
Kentucky Cavalry, seventeen, Cobb’s battery, ten,
and Cluke’s regiment, thirty-two. More than half
the entire loss fell on the 2nd Kentucky Infantry.
With two hundred and thirty men engaged, Cluke’s
regiment reported a loss of thirty-two, making its
casualties fourteen per cent of the men carried into
the fight. Gano, Chenault and Bennett had twelve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
killed, wounded or missing. Lieutenant-Colonel Cicero
Coleman, of the 8th Cavalry, ever chivalrous and gallant,
while nobly leading a section of his regiment, was
seriously wounded.</p>

<p>Two handsomer men than Colonel Cluke or Lieutenant-Colonel
Coleman could rarely be found in any
organization. Both over six feet, both splendid horsemen,
always erect and graceful in their saddles, and
full of magnetism, they communicated by their superb
presence and their fearless conduct to the men of the
regiment an enthusiasm in war’s operations that was
always inspiring and helpful, and made each man believe
that the result of the conflict was dependent upon
his personal valor.</p>

<p>To the Federals there came a heavy loss of killed
and wounded. Eighteen hundred prisoners were
forced across the Cumberland and were turned in to
the Confederate headquarters at Murfreesboro.</p>

<p>Danger was now imminent on every side. One
could breathe it in the air. An attack from the forces
at Castalian Springs was momentarily expected, but
General Morgan could not resist the impulse to destroy
wagons and stores, and these things were quickly
reduced to ashes. A large amount of clothing was seized
in this fortunate capture. Boots and shoes meant much
to some of the cavalry regiments, especially the 8th
and 11th, who in the march had to reinforce their
worn boots and shoes with pieces of blanket. In the
face of impending and immediate attack the work
of destruction was thoroughly completed. It was
against the creed of Morgan’s men to leave anything
undestroyed that could aid a foe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>A suspicious firing was soon heard in the direction
of Castalian Springs. Quirk’s scouts were doing their
best and bravest to hold the Federals in check. They
were retiring only because the numbers of the enemy
were overwhelming, but the Enfield rifles were speaking
defiance to their assailants, and if they were receding
it was only because prudence bade them go. Colonel
Cluke and his regiment were sent to aid in the show of
resistance and the pressure, still increasing, became so
great that Gano’s regiment, which in the meantime
had arrived, was sent to their support.</p>

<p>Time was never more valuable to any army than
to this little Confederate brigade now leaving Hartsville.
The Cumberland River, difficult of fording, was
in front, and an enemy three times as strong was now
pressing vigorously behind.</p>

<p>The artillery, which had been brought along,
together with the captured guns, was placed on the
south bank to protect the crossing. Courtesy to the
conquered ceased to be the order of the hour. The
captured were urged and driven forward at the highest
possible speed. Some were hesitant about going, but
war knows nothing of the law of politeness and their
captors demanded double quick march from the crestfallen
and distressed prisoners. The wagons were
placed in front. Two captured Parrot guns made
splendid companions for the “bull pups.” These
remained with the Division until General Morgan’s
capture in Ohio, July 26th, 1863. One of these was
called “Long Tom” and was the object of great
admiration and was held in truest affection by the
whole force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>As the Confederates approached the river, the infantry
began to be very chummy with the cavalry.
At the highest possible speed and with great haste they
had marched away from the scene of their splendid
achievement. They had not been subjected to the
bath which a few hours before had been the fate of the
horsemen and they had no fancy to ford the icy stream,
even under the Federal pressure behind them. A
glorious victory had been won, in the winning of which
every part of the brigade had borne a distinguished
part. Heroes of a common venture, they were alike
jubilant over the brilliant work of the morning, and
when they got down to the stream it required neither
pleading nor threats for the infantry to secure seats
behind the horsemen, and so, two on each steed, with
their legs lifted high out of the cold water, the patient,
gentle, useful horses carried the victors to the south
side of the stream.</p>

<p>Among the triumphs and congratulations, the cavalry
was not indisposed to be generous to the unfortunate
prisoners, and after the infantry had been delivered
on the south side, where they might defend any attack
of the approaching Federals, now extremely annoying
and persistent, they recrossed the stream, and each
horseman took a prisoner behind him and thus ferried
him over, but the pursuit became fiercer and stronger,
and as the cavalry, which were fighting the advance
from Castalian Springs approached the stream, the
situation became so emergent that the unfortunate
prisoners who had not gotten a seat behind the cavalry
were forced into the stream, which reached their
waists, and required a wade through the rapid, cold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
current. This was not done without some threats of
violence, but the water was to be preferred to bullets,
and reluctantly, and with loud protests against such
violation of the laws of war, accompanied by all sorts
of “back talk,” the Federal prisoners were rushed
through the water and with a close line of horsemen on
either side were hurried across the stream. The
victors had not thought of parole. Even if they had,
there was no time to carry out the details of such a
process. The eighteen hundred prisoners would look
well in the column of the returning heroes when they
reached Baird’s Mills and Murfreesboro, and with
grim grip, the Confederates held on to their prisoners.
Here and there one dropped out, but almost the entire
number was gotten safely over the river and finally
delivered to the guards at headquarters.</p>

<p>The rear guard bravely defended every foot of the
ground. They were anxious to get away, but prudence
and pride alike required that they should make stubborn
resistance, and with every expedient known to
cavalrymen, they delayed the approach of the Federal
forces. The Federal commander had some disquieting
fears about the number of men that were engaged in
the expedition, and he did not press the pursuit as
savagely as he would have done had he known that less
than seven hundred men were standing in the pathway
he must travel to reach his adventurous foes, who were
now divided by the rapid currents of the icy stream.</p>

<p>A part of the Confederate dead who so gloriously
had died were left behind. Their enemies gave them
burial. War destroys the tenderness of sentiment.
The safety of their own lives was more important than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
the sepulture of the slain, however bravely they had
gone down in the struggle. Most of the wounded were
placed in wagons and ambulances, which were driven
away from the scene of carnage and battle. The infantry,
in defense of their wounded comrades, had the
call been made, would have been extremely dangerous
customers. The economics of war are ruthless. The
living, the fighters, are to be considered, and then the
maimed and dead. On the horsemen fell the burden of
the defense of the rear. During all the expedition, the
web-footed infantry had gotten the worst of the deal,
and the cavalry, gay, happy and mounted, were disposed
to place no unnecessary work upon their comrades
who were trudging their way back to their comrades,
who were longing to hear the tidings of what battle
had brought to those who had been selected for so
dangerous a mission.</p>

<p>If the infantry had looked with side glances at the
cavalry when at Baird’s Mills, they had now lost the
recollection of such ungenerous feelings in admiration
for the horsemen who, dismounted, had manifested a
courage and valor equal to their own, and who, in the
charge and advance upon the enemy at Hartsville, and
in standing off the Federal pursuers, had displayed an
intrepidity that was not unworthy of any Kentucky
Confederates, be they men who walked or men who rode
to battle. Whenever Hartsville was recalled or its
experiences were freshened in their minds, there was
no distrust of the steadfastness of the 3rd, 8th and 11th
Kentucky Cavalry, and the gallant 9th Tennessee, and
by common consent the 2nd and 9th Kentucky Infantry
admitted these regiments which had been with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
them at Hartsville into the full brotherhood of war’s
heroes.</p>

<p>The captured guns and the four pieces brought by
Morgan were pounding away on the south bank of the
river and hurling shot and shell at the pursuers on the
north bank, serving notice on the Federals that thus far
and no farther could they come. It never entered the
minds of the Federals that the Confederates were so
few in number. They could not understand how any
commander with the slightest prudence would expose
his men to such risk as Morgan had dared. It would
have been questionable for even cavalry to have undertaken
such a campaign, but to jeopardize two of the
best regiments of infantry in the army of Tennessee
by marching and fighting so far from their military
base, and with such liability to attack on the rear and
flank, was inconceivable to the Federals who were
pursuing. They concluded that there were at least
three times as many in the battle as had captured
their comrades at Hartsville. Colonels Harlan and
Moore estimated Morgan’s fighting force at five
thousand, and Federal officers declared that they had
seen several regiments of infantry and cavalry standing
across the river awaiting the return of their comrades
who had gone over the stream and won victory at
Hartsville.</p>

<p>By eleven o’clock the agony was past. The pursuit
was ended. Joy and complacency filled the hearts
of the infantry as they tramped back to Baird’s Mills.
They did not ask to ride any more. The cavalry
marched in the rear and stood guard and waited for
approaching foes. None came. After crossing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
stream, courtesy and generosity prompted kindness
to the blue-coated prisoners. There was no word of
unkindness spoken.</p>

<p>Along the Confederate lines, they were received
with surprise, and wonder staggered credence to believe
how few could have accomplished so much or that
any men in such rigorous weather could have so quickly
covered so great a distance, or against such odds have
won so marvelous a victory.</p>

<p>For a little while the Federal commanders were
dazed. On December 7th General Rosecrans wired
General George H. Thomas as follows: “Do I understand
they have captured an entire brigade of our
troops without our knowing it, or a good fight?” And
at one thirty o’clock the same day there came from the
President at Washington the following message: “The
President to Major General George H. Thomas:
The President demands an explanation of the Hartsville
affair. Report in detail exact position, strength
and relative distances of your troops between Gallatin
and Hartsville, and causes of disaster as far as known
to you.”</p>

<p>On December 10th, the rage and indignation became
more pronounced, and General Halleck wired from
Washington: “The most important of the President’s
inquiries has not been answered. What officer or
officers are chargeable with the surprise at Hartsville
and deserve punishment?” Later General Halleck
wired the President: “I respectfully recommend that
Colonel Moore, 104th Illinois Volunteers, be dismissed
from the service for neglect of duty in not properly
preparing for the enemy’s attack on Hartsville, Tennessee.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
Afterwards Colonel Moore was allowed to resign
on the ground of disability after long imprisonment by
the Confederates.</p>

<p>Meagre and exaggerated reports were spread among
the Confederates of the number of men that had reduced
such a numerous company to prisoners. The
whole army with glad cheers along the line greeted the
return of the victors. Much was said of the cavalry,
but the chiefest and highest meed of praise was
awarded to the infantry. In less than thirty-six hours
they had marched forty-five miles over trying and
difficult roads, had fought a battle, with their associates
had captured eighteen hundred prisoners and
brought these back across an almost impassable stream
in the midst of fierce winter weather.</p>

<p>General Bragg, more or less phlegmatic, was moved
to enthusiastic praise. He tendered to General Morgan
his thanks and assured him and his troops of his unbounded
admiration.</p>

<p>He said: “I take great pleasure in commending
the endurance and gallantry of all engaged in this remarkable
expedition.” He predicted that such valor
and courage had before it higher and yet more magnificent
victories, and to appeal still more strongly to the
pride of those who had been engaged in this wonderful
conflict, he ordered that hereafter, upon the battle
flags of all organizations which had taken part in this
battle, the name of “Hartsville” should be emblazoned,
to remind the world forever of the bravery, endurance,
enterprise and courage of those who had there won such
great distinction.</p>

WHEELER’S RAID INTO TENNESSEE,<br>
AUGUST, 1864</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The tremendous exactions of the Confederate
cavalry, in the summer and fall of 1864, gave
severest test of both their physical resistance
and their patriotism. Food for man and beast was
reduced to the minimum of existence. As food lessened,
work increased, and the dumb brutes felt more
sorely than man the continual shortening of rations.</p>

<p>In July official reports showed that for three days
the cavalry of General Wheeler received thirteen pounds
of corn per horse. The regular ration was ten pounds
of corn and ten pounds of hay. As against the amount
experience had shown essential for maintaining strength
and vigor, the Confederate horsemen saw the beasts
that they loved even as their own lives cut to three and
one-third pounds of corn, just one-third of what nature
demanded, outside of rough provender, such as hay or
oats. The horse could live, but that was all. To put
these starving beasts into active work, to exact of them
thirty miles a day, with an average of one hundred and
eighty pounds on their backs, was only to leave many
of them stranded by the roadside to die of starvation
and neglect, or to be picked up by the country folks
with the hope that a ration of grass or leaves would, in
the course of months, bring them back to health.</p>

<p>The cavalryman often starved himself without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
complaint to help his horse. When it comes to work
with insufficient food, as between man and brute, the
man is the stronger. The spirit of the man, like the
air plant, extracts life from his surroundings and thus
begets a strength and virility to which the beast is a
stranger. At this period there was a little green corn
found here and there, in the patches planted by the
women and children, who were fighting for life in the
rear of the army, where war’s relentless ravages had
left for beasts little but the air, a sprinkle of grass,
the branches of the trees, or the sprouts that had come
up about the roots. These most frequently were the
largest part of the ration served the southern cavalry
horse. The men watched these animals grow weaker
day by day, and when corn was issued to the soldiers to
be parched, they took a small portion for themselves,
and patting the noses of the mounts with fondest touch,
they would slip a part of their own food into the mouths
of the steeds they had learned to love as if they were
human.</p>

<p>Western Confederate genius was now engaged in
wrestling with the destruction of Sherman’s lines of
communication. It was one hundred and fifty-two
miles from Chattanooga, the real base of Sherman’s
supplies, to Atlanta. Bridges and trestles were numerous,
and against these again and again Confederate
ingenuity exhausted its power and its enterprise.
Sherman was dreaming of a march to the sea. Hood,
who succeeded Johnston, was dreaming of flank movements
and marches to the rear, and while these leaders
were figuring and counting the cost, upon the cavalrymen
was laid the heaviest burdens of conflict. Former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
conditions had now been reversed. In the earlier
stages of the War, the Federals were chiefly solicitous
to repel cavalry incursions and raids, but now the
Confederates were to swap jobs and thwart Federal
assaults on lines of communication. This put upon
the Confederates increased vigilance and demanded
of them that they should make military bricks without
the straw necessary to their manufacture.</p>

<p>The proper care of horses was now an important
part of the martial regime. If the men were thoughtless
enough to overburden their mounts, experience
and necessity told the officers, responsible for results,
that these details must be watched, and higher authority
must intervene to protect the animals, now
even as necessary as men in the operations of the hour.</p>

<p>On August 9th, 1864, an order was issued looking
to a most rigid enforcement of this sane and wise regulation.
No officer of any grade or any soldier was
allowed to carry any article outside of his gun and his
cartridge box, other than a single blanket and one oil
cloth. Naught but something to warm the body and
protect the skin would be tolerated, and once, every
day on the march, inspection was a part of every
officer’s duty for the enforcement of this requirement.
Ordnance wagons, caissons and ambulances were subjected
to the same close scrutiny and the immediate
destruction of all contraband was the stern and irrevocable
order of General Wheeler.</p>

<p>General Hood was feeling the constant and relentless
pressure of General Sherman around Atlanta.
Wheeler and Forrest were his only reliance to lessen
the hold that was silently but surely throttling the life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
of the Army of the Tennessee. Something must be
done to relieve this acute situation and to Wheeler and
Forrest, Hood appealed in the extreme hour asking
if they could not cut off or shorten Sherman’s supplies.
If they could compel him to withdraw some thousands
of his men, there might yet be a chance. Without these,
it could only be a question of days, mayhap with good
fortune, weeks. No one could foretell what a brief
span might bring forth, and so, catching at faintest
hope, these two wondrous cavalry soldiers were to take
another turn at the wheel.</p>

<p>It was believed by General Hood, and in this
General Forrest concurred, that if Wheeler could pass
around Sherman’s army, tear up the railroad north
of Atlanta, then reaching to Chattanooga, force a
passage of the Tennessee River, swing around towards
Knoxville and thence down into Middle Tennessee
and assail Nashville and wreck the railroads between
Nashville and Chattanooga, this, accompanied by
Forrest’s assailment of the lines in Western Tennessee
and Southwestern Kentucky, would, if it was within
the lines of human possibilities, loosen Sherman’s hold
on Hood’s throat.</p>

<p>General Wheeler had concentrated four thousand
men at Covington, Ga., forty miles south of Atlanta.
The best horses were selected. They were shod and
fitted by every means at hand to enter upon one of the
most wearying marches of the War. They would
perforce rely on some captures of steeds. The Confederate
cavalry never failed to count on the United
States government to supply a full share of their
wants, when thus in need. With the long, long tramps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
ahead, there were even some dismounted men who
resolved to go on this expedition, willing to take the
risk of capture, believing that the uncertainties of war
and the certainties of striking some loose Federal
cavalry force would stand them well in hand, and give
them earth’s now richest treasure, a horse. The
warrior of old had cried out, “My kingdom for a horse,”
but these dejected and bereft horsemen were putting a
higher value on such a priceless gift, and were placing
their lives in the balance, to win, if mayhap they might
win, the coveted prize.</p>

<p>General Hood had calculated that if Wheeler could
safely trust to capture food and ammunition, that
surely he would break Sherman’s line, and that inevitably
Sherman must pay not only some, but much
heed to this active, devastating force in his rear.</p>

<p>No extended rations were allowed to go. A blanket
and gum coat blanket were all the baggage permitted
except a loose horseshoe and a frying pan. It required
only the cooking of some water-softened cornmeal,
made into soggy bread, to supply immediate wants.</p>

<p>The Confederate horsemen had long since learned
the full import of the petition of the Lord’s prayer,
“Give us this day our daily bread.” He had shortened
it up to say, “Give us one square meal”; and he laid
down on the wet or hard ground, covered his face with
his worn hat or tattered blanket, and let no thought
of the next meal disturb his dreamless sleep.</p>

<p>Starting on this long journey, General Wheeler
swung eastwardly to avoid, as far as possible, Federal
interruption. In less than twenty-four hours, he began
to let his enemies know that he was in the saddle. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
struck the railroad near Marietta, Ga., and proceeded
to wreck it for miles. He and his followers were hungry.
Their larder was empty. They felt certain that
Sherman’s supply trains were on the march between
Chattanooga and Atlanta. Their horses needed corn,
their bodies needed food, and they resolved to apply
the old doctrine of “He takes who may; he keeps who
can.” A long train of cars was captured, but men and
their horses could not eat engines and cars. Then
came the comforting message, through friendly sympathizers,
that a long wagon train, well guarded, was
on the highway a little farther north. This glad news
quickened hope and cheered body and soul. A short
distance away, a great vision crossed their gaze. When
it first stood out upon the horizon, the weary troopers
rubbed their eyes, pinched their tired limbs, to discover
if they beheld a mirage, or was it real things that
loomed across their perspective. The men first saw
horses and mules, as if trees walking. The white tops
of the commissary schooners, led horses, trailing mules,
and a vast horde of driven beeves moving southward,
headed for Sherman’s headquarters, developed into a
reality. The only drawback was men in blue, some
riding, many tramping alongside the wagons. All of
these carried guns, and they had special orders to kill
all who attempted to take these things from their custody.
Necessity is a great incentive, and the Confederates,
with patriotism and hunger impelling,
without preliminary proceedings, made vigorous
assault on the custodians of what to those attacking
was the equal of life itself. The odds were against the
Confederates, but these had so much at stake that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
issue could not long be doubtful. They went after
their enemies with such dash and determination that
the guards soon fled and left to them the possession
of the wagons, the beeves, the horses, the mules and
great stores of good things to eat. The cravings of
nature were quickly met, but, as with hands full,
riders supplied their own bodies, bits were removed
from the mouths of the faithful steeds, and with greatest
dispatch a bountiful supply of shelled corn and oats
was spread upon the ground before the enraptured
vision of the jaded steeds. The lowing, restless cattle
were corralled by the new masters. Doomed to an
early death, it made but little odds whether they fed
men who were clad in blue or gray.</p>

<p>General Hannon, with a guard, soon herded the
precious drove and its course was promptly turned
eastward to escape Federal interference. The captors
hoped to run the gauntlet of Federal pursuit and with
the glorious prize to bring gladness and relief to the
hungry men who, in and about Atlanta, with unfailing
courage, were hanging on to that citadel with the
grim courage of a forlorn hope to save it from capture
and destruction.</p>

<p>These cattle and their guards, although vigorously
pursued, with favoring fortune escaped the imminent
dangers about them and were landed within the Confederate
lines. They would yield more than one million
pounds of choice beef, thirty-five pounds for every
soldier in General Hood’s army. When these lowing
beasts joined the Confederate commissary, there was
universal delight, and many joys were added to those
who so valiantly were defending the environed citadel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
about which so much of Confederate faith was now
centered.</p>

<p>Emboldened by his success, the Confederate chieftain
now followed the railroad, northward from Marietta.
He was going over the ground with which he
became so familiar a few weeks before on Johnson’s
retreat from Dalton to Atlanta. No Federal foresight
could stay the avenging hand of the Confederate
railway wreckers. Dalton, Sherman’s starting point
in the early days of May, was captured, and from
Resaca to that point, in many places the track was
completely torn up. There were Federals behind and
Federals all about, but their presence did not disturb
the game little southern general and his men in gray.
Bridges, trestles, cattle guards, guns, ammunition,
mules, horses, were the things he had calculated to
capture and destroy, and to this work he bent all the
energies of his willing and active followers. In crossing
the streams, the ammunition of every soldier was
inspected by officers and every man was compelled
to tie his cartridge box about his neck to prevent
contact with water. The man, the horse, the gun, the
powder and ball must be kept in the best possible
condition. On these, combined, depended not only
the safety of the command, but the success of the
campaign. A few sentences from General Wheeler’s
order of August 9th, 1864, will tell how stern was the
demand for the protection of the horses who were to
carry their masters on this strenuous march: “No
soldier of any grade whatever will be permitted to
carry any article of private property, except one single
blanket and one oil cloth.” Officers and men alike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
were to share these prevailing and bear these stringent
exactions. There was no complaint against these
drastic regulations. Rarely, if ever, were these orders
disobeyed. With noblest patriotism and sublimest
self-sacrifice, the volunteers under Wheeler recognized
the necessity of such a call and there was no claim of
self-denial and no call of physical privation they were
unwilling to face or endure, if they only might win their
country’s freedom and drive its enemies from its soil.</p>

<p>When marching out of Dalton, the Federal general,
Steedman, furiously assailed Wheeler’s command,
but he was beaten off, and a direct march was made
on Chattanooga. This greatly alarmed the Federal
leader, and he hastened to the rescue of that stronghold;
and then General Wheeler, as if playing hide
and seek, turned again to Dalton, to which place he
was in turn followed by Steedman, only to find his
wary enemy gone. These valuable days for Federal
repair of the railroad were thus consumed in fruitless
marching and countermarching, induced by General
Wheeler’s strategy. This interrupted the use of the
railway for twelve days, and these two hundred and
eighty-eight hours meant much to Sherman’s one
hundred thousand followers, camped on the Chattahoochee.
The exactions of twelve months of war and
alternate occupation of both armies had depleted the
country along the railway of all that could sustain man
or beast, and by the necessities for forage, General
Wheeler was compelled to leave this ravaged territory,
and marched eastwardly towards Knoxville. There
he was sure of reaching supplies, and he quickly turned
his steps towards the valleys along the Tennessee River<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
above Chattanooga. Once before, he had crossed at
Cottonport, forty miles above that city; but when he
came to the scene of his former brilliant operations,
floods filled the banks of the stream and prevented a
passage there. He resolved to follow the line of the
river towards Knoxville and search for some spot at
which he might swim or ferry over. Leaving six companies
of thirty men each along the railway to harass
and alarm the Federals, with the remainder of his troops
he rode away. Those left behind gave a good account
of themselves. More than twenty loaded trains became
victims of their matchless daring, and it was some time
before the enemy knew that General Wheeler had
moved his sphere of operations.</p>

<p>If one will take an enlarged map and start with a
line beginning at Covington, Georgia, forty miles south
of Atlanta, where General Wheeler concentrated his
troops on August 10th, to begin this expedition, and
trace through all the journeyings of his command for
the next twenty-eight days, some idea can be obtained
of the tremendous energies and wonderful skill that
marked this raid. To make this ride without let or
hindrance, within the period it covered, with the animals
and supplies possessed by Wheeler’s men, would be
considered a reasonable march; but encumbered with
artillery and ammunition wagons, the sick and wounded
that always must follow in the train of a cavalry incursion
make the difficulties appalling. Hidden
dangers lurked on every side. The constant pursuit, as
well as the constant change in the Federal disposition
of both cavalry and infantry forces, rendered the game
at all places and hours distractingly uncertain, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
only a leader of consummate energy, combined with
masterful skill, could hope to escape in safety from such
desperate and perilous complications. To make the
most conservative estimate of excursions from the main
line of march would require something like six hundred
and fifty miles of riding on this raid. No well-appointed
commissary was present to feed man and hungrier
beast. These must live from hand to mouth and either
take food from the enemy or to impress it from people,
loyal in most cases to the South, and already so impoverished
by war that starvation was a real and ever
present factor. In partisan warfare, soldiers do not
care much for the taking of even the necessaries of life
from those who oppose or do not sympathize with
them; but to go into a farmer’s barn lot and take his
hay, corn and oats, shoot down his hogs and cattle
for food, and clean up his chicken coops, because you
are compelled to take these or starve yourself and your
horse; and knowing all the while the owner loves the
cause and country for which you are fighting, and
probably his sons and relations are somewhere out in
the army contending for that which is dear to you and
them, is bound to create a profound sense of grief and
sorrow and even shame in any honorable soul. These
takings of food from sympathizers often leave in the
hearts of true men bitter and more depressing memories
then the death and wounds on the battlefield, or
the pathetic scenes where comrades in the cheerless
hospital are wrestling with disease in a combat for
life.</p>

<p>If General Wheeler and his men could not find and
take from Federals the things that were essential to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
life, then they were compelled to despoil in the struggle
for self-preservation their own friends and countrymen.</p>

<p>There were but few soldiers in General Wheeler’s
four thousand men who rode out of Covington, Georgia,
on August 10th, 1864, who, as between the consequences
of battle and the taking from aged men, helpless
women and dependent children their only food
supply, would not have gladly accepted the alternative
of battle with absolute cheerfulness and the chances
it brought of death or wounding. Two-thirds of the
territory to be traversed was a friendly country. In
East Tennessee, Confederates found few supporters,
or well-wishers, and here the southern soldier was not
disturbed about discrimination; but Middle Tennessee
and Northern Georgia were almost unanimously loyal,
and ever greeted the legions in gray with smiles and
benedictions, and so long as they had any surplus over
starvation’s rations, would gladly have shared it with
the trooper who followed Wheeler, Forrest or Morgan
on their arduous rides.</p>

<p>In all this long march and hard campaign, there was
not one day, hardly one hour, in which there was not
contact with the enemy. The Federals appreciated,
as well as the Confederates, what the destruction of the
railway between Atlanta and Chattanooga meant to
Sherman and his great army camped southward in
Georgia. If forced by lack of food and munitions of
war to recede, it meant losing what had cost a year’s
vigorous campaigning and the waste of the thousands
of lives that in battle or by disease had been paid as
the price of winning the most important citadel of
Georgia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>The twenty-four days, from August 10th to September
3rd, were eventful days in the history of the
army of the Tennessee. Sherman sat down in front
of Atlanta in July, and by slow degrees was endeavoring
by siege and starvation to drive General Hood away.
This proved a most difficult task. From Atlanta to
Nashville was two hundred and eighty-eight miles, and
while Sherman might hammer Hood’s lines south of
Atlanta, Hood had most potential wreckers in Forrest
and Wheeler to operate on this three hundred miles,
upon one hundred and fifty-two of which, from Chattanooga
to Atlanta, he must rely for those things
without which war could not be carried on. Against
this line of Sherman’s, the Confederate cavalry again
and again were hurled, always with tremendous effect.
Now and then they put Sherman and his men on half
rations, and the ordnance department counted their
stores to calculate what might happen if the pressure
was not relieved. No phase of the war presented nobler
evidences of skill, great self-sacrifice or physical endurance,
as month after month, Wheeler and Forrest
went out upon their errands of destruction and waste.
Over in Virginia, Stuart and Hampton grandly met
the conditions that faced them there. Across the
Mississippi, in Arkansas, Missouri and Texas, brave
spirits were fearlessly keeping up the conflict against
ever-increasing odds; but along the Mississippi, the
Tennessee and the Cumberland were surroundings
that invoked a breadth of genius and a scope of operation
that excited wonder and admiration everywhere
the story was told. The distance here was so great,
nature’s obstacles so pronounced, that those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
measured and calculated and mastered these, needed
something almost above the human to forecast and
overcome.</p>

<p>The War, from 1861 to 1865, developed many
problems that no soldier in the past had ever faced.
There were no experiences that the books described
that could fully guide the men in this department as to
the best means of harassing and defeating armies that
came like Sherman’s.</p>

<p>For the special work that the time and place had
cut out for the South, Providence provided two men
whose names must go down in human history as superb
examples of skill, daring, resource and patience, which
will always give them a proud place in the annals of
war. Whether we write Forrest and Wheeler, or
Wheeler and Forrest, it counts not. Different minds
may gauge them differently, but at the end, all who
study what they did and how they did it, must set
them down as amongst the greatest soldiers of the world.
Those who looked upon their faces might not catch at
once the splendor of their powers. They were totally
unlike in most of their physical makeup, but when once
the beholder looked into their eyes, the only safe index
to the soul and mind, there was in both of these remarkable
men something that at once challenged admiration
and proclaimed superiority. In both of their countenances,
the Creator stamped valor, intrepidity, self-confidence,
individual force and genius and power of
achievement. To thus speak of these two extraordinary
men takes nothing from the achievements or talents of
other great southern cavalry leaders. Stuart, Hampton,
Morgan, Marmaduke, Shelby and many others filled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
their spheres with a luminosity that age cannot dim.
It may be that it is probably true that Forrest and
Wheeler would have failed when Stuart, Hampton
and Morgan won. Each takes, by his performance,
an exalted place in the resplendent galaxy of the South’s
heroic world. One cannot be judged sharply by the
other. There was so much that was brave, skillful and
intrepid in them all, that the pen of criticism, by way
of comparison, falls paralyzed by the wonder, love and
admiration for the various achievements of these
military prodigies.</p>

<p>Even during the last days of the War, men who
wrote rather than fought, attempted to draw comparisons
between the cavalry leaders and what they had
accomplished; but the hour for this is now forever
gone, and they who love the South and its precious
memories sit and gaze in rapture and astonishment at
what all and any of these men, with such meager resources,
were able to accomplish in those days of darkness
and trial, and what the men who followed the
stars and bars were doing and daring so constantly in
their struggle with an opposing destiny, to win a
nation’s crown for the Confederate States.</p>

<p>Some say that Wheeler’s raid through Northern
Georgia, into Middle and Eastern Tennessee, in the last
days of August and the first days of September, 1864,
is a performance so unique and marvelous that it takes
a place in history by itself.</p>

<p>Others point to Forrest’s raid into Middle Tennessee,
which, succeeding that of General Wheeler, sets
a mark on such campaigns that none other ever reached;
but those who love Morgan, with the pride of his great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
achievements, point to Hartsville and the Christmas
raid of 1862 as the most remarkable achievement of
the great performances of southern cavalry. Another
voice speaks of Stuart’s Chickahominy raid and of his
ride from Chambersburg to the Potomac, and the
Battle of Fleetwood Hill (Brandy Station) as overshadowing
all other cavalry triumphs, while others
call to mind Hampton’s cattle raid, his Trevilian Station
battle and campaign with his jaded mounts, and
cry out, “Here is the acme of cavalry successes”; but
when we recall what all of these men and their chivalrous
followers accomplished for the renown and glory
of a nation whose life span was only four years, the
human mind is dazzled with the wealth and extent
of the glorious memories that gather about the pages
which tell of southern cavalry achievement, service
and fame.</p>

<p>When General Wheeler, on the 28th day of August,
marched up almost to the gates of Nashville and terrified
its defenders, he carried with him a motley crowd.
The brigades of General Williams and General Anderson
had not returned to General Wheeler. They moved
east and did incalculable service for the cause in saving
the salt works, in Southwestern Virginia, upon which
the people and the armies of the Confederacy, west
of the Mississippi River, depended for salt, which, next
to bread, was the staff of life. But the defection,
whether wise or unwise, reduced General Wheeler’s
force, already scant enough, to only two thousand men,
and thereby imperilled the success of the incursion and
threatened the destruction of General Wheeler’s entire
command, which at that time would have proven an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
irreparable loss to Hood’s army. The rise in the
Tennessee River had forced General Wheeler to extend
his line far east of where he had intended originally
to go. These unexpected currents carried him miles
beyond Knoxville and out of his chosen path, and the
detour south and east of Knoxville to cross the rivers
greatly stayed the work of wrecking the railroads
between Nashville and the South. Once he was over the
Tennessee and its tributaries, the Holston and the
French Broad, General Wheeler turned his face westward.
The country through which he was to march
was in some parts unfriendly. At Clinton, Kingston and
other points on his way, he found scattered Federal
camps and supplies, but what he needed most now was
horses. He had come three hundred miles, and three
hundred more must he traverse before he could draw
a long breath or be sure that he could, without disaster,
reach General Hood’s quarters. Day by day, his
beasts became more jaded. No animal, which could
carry a man, was left behind, and what could not be
taken from the enemy must be impressed from friend
or foe along the road which he was passing. The extra
shoe or pair of horseshoes with which every prudent
cavalryman provides himself, where it is possible,
when starting on these marches, had in most cases been
exhausted. The company farrier or the comrade who
could put on a horseshoe loomed up as the noblest
benefactor of the hour. Some were already dismounted.
Love, money and force were all beginning
to be powerless to mount those who composed the
columns. Then, too, ammunition was getting very
scarce, and the few cartridges which now rattled in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
partly emptied cartridge boxes were constant warnings
to the commander to seek his base of operations. All
these things spoke to General Wheeler with forceful
emphasis, but he also remembered his work was not
fully done. The long detour around Knoxville had
changed his march, but it had not changed his plan
or his purpose, and he could not be satisfied until he
grappled again with the railroads which supplied Sherman
and put out of commission some more bridges,
trestles and cars and supply stations south of Nashville.
The road by Sparta, McMinnville, Lebanon,
Murfreesboro and intervening places was long, rough
and rocky. It proved very trying to the speechless
beasts who had now marched, counting the detours, an
average of over thirty miles a day. The men had done
the fighting, but the beasts had done the carrying, and
the beasts in these raids always got the worst of it.
The way home was not distressingly: beset with enemies
until the vicinity of Nashville would be reached, but
there was a sufficient sprinkle of foes to keep the
southern riders aware that they were engaged in war,
and no twenty-four hours passed without some evidence
of the presence of the Federals. The march
around Knoxville had mystified the Federal leaders.
They were as surprised as General Wheeler that he had
gone so far east, but now that he had turned north and
westward, none had wisdom enough to prophesy where
he would turn up in the very near future. General
Wheeler had a wide, wide territory before him. He
might strike in north of Nashville and pass around
through West Tennessee, or he might follow the Louisville
&amp; Nashville Railroad north and destroy that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
great artery of commerce. Whither he would go, none
could even guess, and when Grant at Washington, and
Sherman at Atlanta, pleaded for some tidings of the
aggressive Confederate and begged to know whither
he had gone, the men watching Middle and East
Tennessee could only answer, “We cannot tell where he
is or into what place he will come.” As the posts became
scarcer General Wheeler traveled the harder, and he
soon put in an appearance at Sparta and then at
McMinnville, the last only sixty miles from Nashville.
He was getting close to the danger line. At this juncture,
General Wheeler’s difficulties began to greatly
enlarge. His fighting men, with the loss of Williams
and Anderson, had been cut down, even with several
hundred of recruits, to twenty-five hundred men.</p>

<p>On the 30th of August, he made a stirring patriotic
appeal for every able-bodied man to flock to his standard.
He pointed out what Georgia was doing in demanding
the services of every male from seventeen to
sixty-five, and he pleaded with all who could fight or
were willing to fight, to gather under his standard and
to go to the help of their fellow-Tennesseans, who, down
at Atlanta, were meeting every call unreservedly and
rendering every service to stay the tide of conquest.</p>

<p>This appeal did not fall on deaf or unresponsive ears.
Two thousand came to join Wheeler and hundreds more
to take place with other commands, and almost a mob
followed his line of march. Some of them brought
guns, most all of them horses, but twenty-five hundred
men were to do the fighting for this unorganized host.
Only twenty-five hundred could fight, but they could
and all must eat, and the impoverished country could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
not maintain this hungry throng. A supply for all of
these could only find sustenance in Federal storehouses,
and to these General Wheeler turned his attention,
ever keeping in mind that under all the pressure about
him, he had come to harass and distress his foes, and
this must not be omitted. Forcing his way northwardly
from McMinnville to Lebanon, thirty miles west of
Nashville, his enemies became almost desperate, and
the commandant at Gallatin, twelve miles from Lebanon,
burned up a great supply of stores and hastily
decamped. Several other stations joined in this move
for safety. Of what was ahead of him, General Wheeler
had no accurate news. On a straight line, he was
nearly three hundred miles from Hood, and if the pace
became desperate, Hood in the end must become his
best backer outside of his own gallant and intrepid
followers. Cutting in behind Murfreesboro, thirty
miles south of Nashville, with apparent indifference to
consequences, he turned sharply to the north again
and came up within eight miles of Nashville, and with
his pickets in sight of the spires and smoke, he began
to wreck the railroad leading to Chattanooga. The
Federals did not appear to know just where the bold
leader was and they did not care where he went if he
kept out of Nashville, but in the very shadow of its
domes, he set his wreckers to work demolishing the
line which meant so much to Sherman. These experienced
destroyers made haste in their work of
ruin. Moving southward, they left savage marks to
tell of their presence, and the burning ties and twisted
iron informed the onlooker that experienced men were
engaged in this mission. General Wheeler had only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
occasion to keep out of the path of large forces. Stockades
were exempt, except where their occupants had
fled, and for seventy miles south of Nashville, the
wrecking went vigorously on. Rousseau, Steedman and
Granger, who were managing the watch for Sherman,
either did not know where Wheeler actually was or
they did not appear overly anxious to stop his progress.
Following the Tennessee &amp; Alabama Railroad for seventy
miles with leisurely movements, General Wheeler,
seemingly regardless of his foes, pursued his appointed
way to a position north of Florence, Alabama. General
Wheeler’s audacity apparently paralyzed the efforts of
his pursuers. At Franklin, they had forced some sharp
fighting, and here the chivalrous major general, John H.
Kelly, fell. Rarely did the South, with its transcendent
oblations on the altar of freedom, make nobler offering
than this gifted army officer. A graduate of West
Point, endowed with great military genius and burning
with unbounded patriotism, few men with his opportunities
did more for the South than he. In the full
tide of a magnificent and brilliant career, he died,
leading his men on to battle. Trusted and loved by
General Wheeler, he had learned his leader’s methods
and, like him, always went to the front, and when it
was necessary to inspire and enthuse his command, he
led them in every assault upon the lines of their foes.
It was in such work he fell.</p>

<p>Recruits, wagon trains, ambulances and wagons
filled with wounded, dismounted men and broken down
steeds, were the constant reminder to General Wheeler
of the dangers of his perilous retreat. About him, all
these disturbing difficulties and dangers momentarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
stared him in the face. Behind him, vigorous foes
were many times pressing his rear guard. What
forces might be moved by the Federals to block his
path, he could not foresee, but over and above all
these disturbing complications, the Confederate leader,
weighing not more than one hundred and thirty pounds,
sat in his saddle, calm, self-possessed and fearless,
awaiting with a brave heart and an undisturbed soul
all that fate could bring across his path. He felt that
with the brave men about him, war could bring no
conflict and present no experiences from which he
could not, with credit to his chivalrous command,
emerge without defeat and destruction, and in which he
would not punish his enemies and give them experiences
that would cause them to regret that they had ever
assailed his followers or disputed his pathway.</p>

<p>On this great raid, one hundred and twenty dead
and wounded was all toll that the God of War exacted
of General Wheeler’s forces. He compelled
General Sherman to send more than twelve thousand
men to the help of his commands. He had destroyed
the use of one of the railroads on which the Federals
relied for twelve days, the other for thirty days, put
General Sherman’s forces on half rations and created
in his army a dread and apprehension that did much to
help depress their activities and awaken doubts as to
the final outcome of the conflict for Atlanta.</p>

JOHNSONVILLE RAID AND FORREST’S<br>
MARINE EXPERIENCES, NOVEMBER, 1864</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">October and November, 1864, covered the
most successful and aggressive period of General
Forrest’s remarkable exploits. Volumes
could be written describing the details of his marvellous
marches and his almost indescribable triumphs with
the means and men at his command. From August 23rd
to October 15th, 1864, his capture of Athens, Alabama,
the expedition into middle Tennessee, the destruction
of the Tennessee and Alabama railway, the capture
of Huntsville, destruction of the Sulphur trestles,
the battle at Eastport, had presented an array of
experiences and won victories enough to make him
and his men heroes for the years to come. Within
these fifty-three days the actual and incidental losses
inflicted upon the Federals cannot be fully estimated.
He had killed and captured thirty-five hundred men
and officers of the Federal Army, added nine hundred
head of horses to his equipment, captured more than
one hundred and twenty head of cattle, one hundred
wagons and their supplies, and possessed himself of
three thousand stand of small arms and stores for his
commissary ordnance and medical supplies, which
made glad the hearts of his hungry, ill-clad and
debilitated followers.</p>

<p>Six long truss bridges had fallen before his relentless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
destroyers, one hundred miles of railroad had been
completely wrecked, two locomotives, with fifty freight
cars, had been demolished, thousands of feet of railway
trestles, some of sixty feet in height, had been hewn
down and given over to flames, to say naught of hundreds
of thousands of other property essential to Federal
occupation. He had caught up one thousand men
in Middle Tennessee for his own command and enabled
six hundred men who had either straggled or
been cut off from General Wheeler when he had raided
the same territory a short while before to come out
to the commands. It had cost Forrest three hundred
men and officers, killed or wounded. Some of his
bravest and best had died on the expedition. Many
of them were men whose places could now never be
filled, but according to the economics of war, the price
paid was not too great for the results obtained. He
had traversed over five hundred miles and left a savagely
marked trail of ravage and destruction wherever
he had come. Not a day was without some sort of
contact with the enemy, and every hour was full
of danger and peril, demanding ceaseless vigilance
and wariest care. On January 13th, 1864, a new
Department styled “Forrest’s Cavalry Department”
was organized out of West Tennessee and Northern
Mississippi. Hardly had the new year been ushered
in when the Federal Government, with ten thousand
well-equipped and well-drilled cavalry, undertook to
force a way down from Memphis to Meridian, taking
in some of the Confederate strongholds like Pontotoc,
Okolona, Columbus Junction and Macon, a distance
of two hundred and fifty miles, to end at Macon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
General Sherman was to move from Vicksburg with
an army of twenty thousand troops. Co-operation of
the cavalry was deemed of the greatest importance.
To lead these horsemen, William Sooy Smith, not only
a great engineer, but a successful soldier, was placed
in command. Telegraphic communication had been
opened between Vicksburg and Memphis, so that it
was hoped these forces, thus co-operating, might keep
in touch with each other. General Sherman made
good his march to Meridian, playing havoc with railroad
connections and other property in Mississippi.
General Smith however failed to keep his engagement.
He had been delayed in starting, until the 11th of
February, from his rendezvous, Colliers Station,
twenty-five miles southeastward from Memphis. He
waited here for Colonel George E. Waring, who had
been instructed to come from Columbus, Kentucky,
with another brigade, under orders to unite with General
Smith. Waring left Columbus with several
thousand cavalry, and with the best arms of that
period, and what was considered at that time amongst
the most thoroughly furnished cavalry forces that had
ever gone from the Federal lines. General Smith had
informed General Sherman that Forrest would strike
him somewhere in Northern Mississippi between Cold
and Tallahatchee Rivers. After his invasion of West
Tennessee, General Forrest had been enabled to get
together four brigades under General Richardson,
Colonel McCullough, General Tyree H. Bell and
General Forrest’s brother, Jeffrey E. Forrest. The
Confederates were not inactive, and they prepared to
offer strongest resistance to General Smith. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
State Militia, under General Gholson, were brought
into line. Smith marched for several days unhindered,
and the absence of Confederate forces impressed him
that it would not be long before he would come in
contact with Forrest. Northwestern Mississippi was a
great prairie country, producing the most grain of any
section of the Southwest. When the Federals reached
West Point, Mississippi, there were unmistakable
signs of battle. There General Smith learned that
three Forrests were about, General Nathan Bedford,
Colonel Jeffrey E., and Captain William, and investigation
disclosed that the number of men with Forrest
was about two thousand. General Smith had now
traveled half way from Memphis to Meridian, and
Sherman was waiting and watching for Smith’s coming.
General Forrest had studiously circulated reports
magnifying the number of men under his command.
By the 21st of February, Smith felt that the impending
blow was about to fall. He hesitated and was lost.
He turned back, and Forrest’s hour of advantage had
come. Colonel Waring in his book, “Whip and Spur,”
of this moment speaks as follows: “No sooner had we
turned tail than Forrest saw his time had come, and he
pressed us seriously all day and until nightfall.”
The retrograde movement was just commenced when
Jeffrey Forrest’s orders were to fall in after Captain
Tyler’s battalion and to assail the Federal rear at every
chance. Pursuit was vigorous and active, and General
Smith’s retreat became almost a stampede. It was in
one of these charges that Colonel Jeffrey E. Forrest,
commanding a brigade, the younger brother of General
Forrest, was killed. For over sixty miles, night and day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
a relentless pursuit was kept up. Forrest had four
thousand men that were new troops. A majority of
them had seen service less than six weeks. They were
hardy men but mostly untrained soldiers, but they
prided themselves that they were the equals of any
veterans.</p>

<p>By the time General Smith reached Memphis he
had more of a mob than an army. There was practically
no organization left and it was almost a case of
everybody for himself and devil take the hindmost.
Not two weeks had elapsed since, in the pride of strength
and full of ambitious hopes, they had set out to cripple
and destroy Forrest, and now, with less than fourteen
days to their credit as avengers and destroyers, they
came, humiliated by reverses, scattered in fright, and
with no signs of victory on their colors. Their leaders
could make but little excuse for their ignominious
failure, and the only chance to palliate or mitigate
defeat was to magnify General Forrest’s army that had
at first stood them at bay and then, with pitiless pursuit,
had driven them to the place from whence they
had started with such dazzling dreams of glory and
triumph.</p>

<p>This expedition disposed of, Forrest began at once
to cut out new work. There were no furloughs for
him. War in his mind was constant, ceaseless activity.
The scarcity of horses and ammunition as well as
clothing was a constant charge upon Forrest’s energies.
He could not get from the Confederate quartermaster
or commissary what he most needed, and far out on the
front he could not wait for transportation even if the
Confederates had the essential things. In the Federal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
Army and outposts he always found an unfailing supply
of those things his men must have to faithfully fight.</p>

<p>Three regiments of Kentuckians, about this period,
were sent over to help General Forrest, and they were
fully up to his high standard of fighters. They only
numbered seven hundred men after the decimation
of three years in infantry, but they proved a most
valuable asset. None of his men were more dependable.
Buford, Lyon, Faulkner, Hale, Thompson, Tyler and
Crossland could always be counted on for gallant leadership,
and the men under them were never averse to
fighting at the closest range. These men needed clothing.
The Government had given them poor mounts,
some of them had rope bridles, with no saddles. They
used blankets as a substitute and now and then rode
for a while bareback, until they drew from the Federal
commissary, by force, what they needed. Up in
Kentucky, if any good horses were left after impressment
from both sides, these Kentucky boys would
surely find them. As for clothing, that would come in
far greater quantities than would be desired, and sight
of home faces and home places would make them
stronger for the subsequent work at Bryce’s Cross
Roads, Harrisburg and Johnsonville, and other conflicts,
where only highest courage could avail.</p>

<p>Then, too, the Tennesseans, who had come from
the northwestern part of the State, also needed mounts
and uniforms, and they longed to see what the sad
ravages of war had done for their homes and kindred
in that part of the South where the cauldron of pillage
and bloodshed seemed ever to be seething.</p>

<p>General Forrest reorganized his command into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
four brigades, and on the 12th day of April Fort Pillow
was taken. A year before this, General Forrest had
penetrated a considerable distance into Kentucky
and had captured a number of posts and looked askance
at Fort Pillow. This was deemed a valuable possession,
it was used not only for the defense of the river, but
as a recruiting place for fugitive slaves. The story of
Fort Pillow has been told so often that it need not be
repeated here. The loss of Federals was supposed to
be five hundred killed and an equal number captured.
Forrest’s loss was twenty killed and sixty wounded.
Fort Pillow was considered remarkable among cavalry
achievements. Forrest, with a few untrained soldiers,
had accomplished and won this great victory and
given his foes new reasons for animosity. Much,
very much has been written and spoken about Fort
Pillow. It became a name with which to conjure the
colored troops, and through it abuse was so heaped upon
General Forrest as to create the impression that he was
a brutal, ferocious and merciless monster. The Federal
Congress set afoot an investigation, but Forrest’s
defense from the calumnies heaped upon him satisfied
his friends, if it did not convince his enemies.</p>

<p>The character and antecedents of the garrison had
much to do with the events of the histories connected
with its capture. Renegade Tennesseans and fugitive
slaves comprised the larger part of its defenders.
The white men there had perpetrated many wrongs
and outrages upon the defenseless families of the
Tennesseans under Forrest. Great numbers of his
men had come from the regions where these hideous
wrongs had been inflicted. Feeling was high on both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
sides. Human passions had been thoroughly aroused
in Confederate and Federal hearts, and both sides
were rejoiced at a chance to “have it out.” Neither
side went into the conflict looking for any signs of
surrender, and had the Confederates changed places,
they would have fared no better than those they defeated
and captured. But the fall of the Fort was a
great windfall to General Forrest, and while it increased
the hate of his foes, it detracted nothing from his renown
and fame amongst his own people.</p>

<p>Many Federal generals had tried their hand with
Forrest only to meet failure. William Sooy Smith had
lost, and General Stephen A. Hurlbut had also failed.
General C. C. Washburn had taken his place and then
Samuel D. Sturgis came and then Bryce’s Cross Roads.
Later followed the Confederate defeat at Harrisburg,
which for awhile saddened Forrest’s heart. Wounded
shortly after this battle, General Forrest was forced
to ride in a buggy with his torn foot lifted up so as to
cause him the least pain. It was persistently rumored
that he had died of lockjaw, and there would have been
no tears among the Federals if this had turned out to be
true. By the beginning of August, General Forrest
had recovered from his wounds sufficiently to enable
him to enter upon one of his greatest exploits. Riding
into the heart of Memphis, he caused Generals Washburn,
Buchland and Hurlbut to flee from their beds
at night and seek safety in the forts around the city.
General Washburn’s uniform and effects were captured,
but he managed to escape. General Washburn sought
to lay the blame for this successful and marvelous feat
upon General A. J. Smith. Under all the circumstances,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
Forrest’s raid into Memphis was admittedly amongst
the most brilliant and daring cavalry exploits of the
war. That two thousand men should avoid the cities
in which the Federal garrisons were quartered, pass
them by, travel a hundred miles, and then rush into
the city of Memphis, make good their escape with
an embarrassing contingent of supplies and prisoners,
up to that time had few if any parallels.</p>

<p>The tremendous power and efficacy of the methods
of General Forrest had at last been realized, and the
Government at Richmond resolved to turn Forrest
loose upon Sherman, in connection with General Richard
Taylor, who had command of the department
of the Mississippi. General Taylor, sympathizing
with Forrest in his style of fighting, on the 16th day
of September, 1864, set him afloat for twenty-one days’
operations on the rear of the enemy. Forrest’s entry
into Memphis had caused A. J. Smith’s army to return
to that city and had temporarily withdrawn a large
and threatening force from Mississippi. Up to that
time General Taylor had never seen Forrest. He
described him as a tall, stalwart man with grayish
hair, kindly countenance and slow of speech. Nature
made General Forrest a great soldier. With opportunities
for the development of his marvelous genius, there
could have been no limit to his performances.</p>

<p>On the 16th day of September, Forrest started from
Verona, Mississippi, with three thousand five hundred
and forty-two effective men. He undertook to cross
the Tennessee River at Newport, where boats had
been provided. The artillery, ordnance and wagons
were crossed at Newport, but Forrest waded the river<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
at Colbert Shoals. Chalmers commanded one division
and Buford the other. Reinforcements now joined
Forrest, which made four thousand five hundred
soldiers, four hundred of which, however, were dismounted
and were following on foot with the expectation
of capturing mounts during the raid. These
hardy men were glad, by walking and many times
running, to be allowed to join the expedition. A horse
was the most desirable of all earthly possessions.
They were hesitant at no fatigue and hardship which
led them to a mount. Those who went with Forrest
well knew they would at some point be sure of a captured
beast. They all had some friend who would ride
and tie with them. Here and there, on some short
stretch of good road, they might when nobody was
looking get a lift in an ammunition wagon. Then, too,
they could escape the slush and mud in the bespattered
road, and trotting alongside the fences or passway,
they would find it no great task to keep even with the
artillery and heavily loaded horses, unless when the
haste of battle or the rush of pursuit quickened the pace
of the advancing column. Life was worthless to a
cavalryman under the great leaders of the Confederate
troopers if he had no horse, and thus these nervy men
for days followed the expedition, with unfailing faith
that in a reasonable time General Forrest would at
least give them a sufficient chance with their enemies
to enable them to forage upon the Federal Government
for the much needed steed. None who ever witnessed
these dismounted battalions marching on foot
to the scenes of devastation and battle could fail to be
impressed with the power of the human will or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
strenuosity of the human body under the impulse of
war’s hopes and calls.</p>

<p>At this time there was a railroad which ran from
Nashville, Tennessee, to Decatur, Alabama, called
the Alabama and Tennessee Railroad. This had been
a feeder for Federal commissary and general supplies,
and General Forrest undertook to destroy it. The
Confederates had not been expected. Athens, Alabama,
was the first Federal stronghold to fall. Forrest’s
presence had never been suspected until his
troops were in sight of the place. It surrendered without
contest. Nine hundred prisoners were captured
at Athens. This invasion of Forrest stayed for a little
while Sherman’s great march to the sea. From Pulaski,
Tennessee, General Forrest moved to the Nashville &amp;
Chattanooga Railroad. He reported that the enemy
had concentrated at least ten thousand men on the
27th of September, and on the 28th he began to play
havoc with the railroad at Fayetteville and Tullahoma.
The Federal forces, under the direction of General
Sherman, were concentrated in the hope of capturing
Forrest. General Sherman telegraphed that he could
take care of the line between Atlanta and Chattanooga,
but the line from Nashville to Chattanooga must be
protected by others. The rage of Forrest’s enemies
was evidence enough to convince the men of the South
that he had done his work well. At that time General
Sherman telegraphed to General Grant on the 29th
of September, in which he said, speaking of Forrest,
“His cavalry will travel 100 miles in less time than
ours will travel 10.” He also said, “I can whip his
infantry, but his cavalry is to be feared.” Again he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
telegraphed to General Elliott, chief of the cavalry
department of the Cumberland, “Our cavalry must do
more, for it is strange that Forrest and Wheeler should
encircle around us thus. We should at least make 10
miles to his 100.”</p>

<p>On the 1st of October, on this raid, Forrest reached
Spring Hill, twenty-six miles from Nashville. So far
no reverses. The time had come now for General Forrest
to escape. On the 3rd of October, with all possible
speed, to avoid the Federal columns, he marched
south, reaching Florence, Alabama, where he had
forded the river two weeks before, but now it was
swollen and could no longer be passed. At this point,
in what would be considered almost a crisis, Forrest
was compelled to carry a thousand of his men out to an
island in the Tennessee River, which was filled with an
impenetrable growth of cane and timber of all kinds,
and hide his boats behind the island, while the enemy
was still watching to prevent his troops from crossing.
General Forrest, in speaking of this wonderful expedition,
said, “I captured 86 commissioned officers, 67
government employees, 1,274 non-commissioned officers
and privates and 933 negroes, and killed and
wounded 1,000 more, making an aggregate of 3,360,
being an average of one to each man I had in the engagements.”
He further says, “I captured 800 horses,
7 pieces of artillery, 2,000 stands of small arms, several
hundred saddles, 50 wagons and ambulances with a
large amount of medical, commissary and quartermaster’s
stores, all of which have been distributed to
the different commands.”</p>

<p>Now a still greater victory and a new departure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
in military work was to mark the closing months of
1864, in which General Forrest acted with an independent
command. Towards the end of the war,
Memphis became a center of the most important
operations. The Mississippi was always open and it
gave entrance into the grain fields of the West and
through the Ohio, the Missouri, the Wabash and the
White Rivers, and put at the service of the Federal
Army abundant supplies of food and raiment.</p>

<p>The Tennessee River, the fifth largest stream in the
United States, like the New River, is one of the marvels
of nature. Rising far up in the mountains, close to the
Virginia line, it pushes its way southwardly through
Tennessee, swinging around into Alabama, as if by
some capricious fancy, it changes its direction and then
turns north about four hundred and fifty miles to its
mouth, where it mingles its waters with those of the
Ohio, <em>sixty</em> miles above its union with the Mississippi.
After leaving Alabama, pursuing its course within
fifty miles of the Father of Waters, it appears to be
reluctant to reinforce that stream with which it runs
parallel for hundreds of miles. It would appear according
to reason and nature that it should again have
veered to the west and effected its connection with the
Mississippi, but as if wishing to defy this mighty stream,
it still moves onward and northward. It comes then
within two miles of the Cumberland, which is fed by
the waters from the mountains close to where the
Tennessee River has its source, and then, as if running
a race with the Cumberland, it flows along parallel
with that stream and, at last, wearied by its tortuous
journeys for nine hundred miles, at Paducah it mingles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
its waters with those of the Ohio, and these in turn
pass westward and reach the Mississippi at Cairo.</p>

<p>About one hundred and fifty miles from Memphis,
on the Tennessee River, was a little town called Johnsonville,
and at that time it was at the head of the navigable
part of the Tennessee River. To that point the
larger boats could most always come and it was a great
depot for supplies, and in an emergency these might be
carried over to Nashville or Memphis, as either one
or the other might require.</p>

<p>Forrest was beginning now fully to recover from the
effects of the loss of the troops he trained in the earlier
months of the war. Successful beyond all question
in cavalry service, he had again gathered about him a
corps of almost invincible men. His new recruits and
such soldiers as were reimbued with patriotic impulses,
after having left the army when it abandoned Tennessee,
by Forrest’s coming into West Tennessee, cheerfully
returned to the post of duty and under the impulse
of Forrest’s success, and the love and courage
with which he impressed all who once saw him enter
battle. The ranks of depleted skeleton regiments
were partially filled, and the commanders of these
new organizations had now, under Forrest’s eye and
control, learned how he deemed it wisest to fight,
and they were ready to do and dare all that his impetuous
valor required, or his marvelous skill as a leader
pointed out as the true way to carry on war under the
conditions that then existed in his department.</p>

<p>He had now a division of more than four thousand
men. He felt sure he could trust them in all emergencies,
and he was eager and willing to put them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
the highest test, and he undertook at this period what
will always be considered as a remarkable cavalry
foray, the expedition to Johnsonville, Tennessee.</p>

<p>Before undertaking this arduous work, Forrest
had pleaded for a furlough. This had been promised,
but an emergency arose which neither he nor General
Taylor could foresee or control, and it became impossible
for him to be absent even for a brief while; and so
Chalmers and his division were directed to report to
General Forrest at Jackson, Tennessee, on the 16th day
of October.</p>

<p>General Forrest and General Dick Taylor were
kindred spirits. Their relations were most happy and
pleasant. They were men who fought the same way
and thought the same way, and Taylor recognized the
greatness of Forrest and fully understood that he did
best when left to his own devices.</p>

<p>On October 12th, 1864, Forrest telegraphed Chalmers,
commander of one division, “Fetch your wagons
and the batteries with you. I will supply you with
artillery ammunition at Jackson.” Buford was ordered
to take up his line of march for Lexington, a
short distance from the Tennessee River, where Forrest
had crossed in his December, 1862, expedition.
Gun boats and transports were being moved along
the Tennessee River. These could go a little south of
Chattanooga, and the line of communication had been
protected and held open from the river to General
Sherman and his men. Forrest had resolved to destroy
some of these gunboats and capture some of the transports.
He needed some new guns, the clothing, shoes,
arms and ammunition of his troopers needed replenishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
and, too, he had a conviction that he could enact
such scenes on the Tennessee as would disquiet Sherman
at Atlanta and by imperiling the river transportation,
and destroying the railroads north of Chattanooga,
he could bring Sherman, by sheer starvation,
out of Georgia. It was a splendid conception, and could
the Confederacy have sent Forrest on one line and
General Wheeler on the other, it would have stopped
or delayed the march to the sea, and prolonged the
war another year. Optimists said, it might bring final
victory to the banners of the Southland.</p>

<p>On this Johnsonville raid, as often before, he
marched with such tremendous rapidity and covered
his movements so thoroughly that the enemy knew
nothing of either his plans or his positions, until far up
in Tennessee they felt the touch of his avenging powers.
He had parked batteries at Paris Landing and Fort
Heiman on the Tennessee River, and his men began to
wait for the unsuspecting Federals before his foes had
an inkling of what he really intended to do. He struck
the river about forty miles above Johnsonville. The
two batteries were five miles apart. He knew what
all his enemies were doing, but they caught naught of
where he had gone, or was going. Like a great beast
of prey, he hid along the river banks in the cane and
undergrowth, watching and waiting for his victims
to cross his path, or to come his way. A vast majority
of the people of West Tennessee were intensely loyal
to the South, and it was only here and there that
Federal persuasion could win from a native any facts
about the movements of any Confederate force.
News about Federal movements was always accessible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
to Forrest’s scouts, who knew accurately every road
and by-way of this entire region. It was one hundred
and fifty miles to Memphis where a large Federal force
was stationed, but none passed Forrest’s line to carry
tidings of his doings, and when Forrest’s guns opened
on the transports and gunboats on the river, north of
Johnsonville, it was a most startling revelation to the
Federals of the ubiquitous movements of the Confederate
chieftain. The Federal generals knew he was loose
somewhere, but they had no power of divining where
he might break out to terrorize their garrisons and
destroy their railroads or depots of supplies. Forrest,
Wheeler, Hampton, Stuart and Morgan had the most
efficient scouts that ever kept an army informed
of an enemy’s movements. Forrest’s territory for
operation was larger than that of any of these other
leaders, and he never once failed, thanks to the courage,
daring and intelligence of his scouts to know just how
many they were and just where he would find his
foes.</p>

<p>A grateful people will some day build a monument
to these daring and successful purveyors of information,
who deserve a very large share in the splendid victories
and triumphs of the Confederate cavalry. The South
may never know their names, but the world will some
day fairly and justly measure what they were in the
campaigns which will live forever amongst the most
brilliant of military exploits.</p>

<p>Forrest was playing a great game. He had taken
big risks and was figuring on tremendous stakes. In
the night time he made all necessary dispositions.
His scouts had told him that boats were coming and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
Forrest was glad, for he had come for boats. The
Confederates had waited both patiently and impatiently
all the night long. Patiently, because they felt
sure of their prey; impatiently, for they anxiously
desired to feed upon the good things the vessels contained,
and also because they had made a long and
trying march and, tiger-like, they were ready to spring
upon the victim. It was chilly and raw. It had been
raining heavily off and on during the past week. The
river bottoms, or even the hill tops, were not comfortable
places in October without fire, and these
things, added to the excitement that preceded great
actions, made the Confederate troopers long for the
coming of the rising sun. There was something in the
very surroundings that gave portent of great deeds
and glorious triumphs on the morrow, when they
should be sent forth on their mission, and it was difficult
to repress, even amidst their depressing environments,
the enthusiasm which they felt sure must
break forth in the inevitable happenings of the next
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of October 29th, the <em>Mazeppa</em>,
a splendid steamboat, laden with freight, and two
barges which she was towing to Johnsonville, came
around the great bend of the Tennessee River. The
sections of artillery had been posted some distance
apart on the river. Passing the lower one, the boatmen
discovered its presence only to find themselves between
the two hostile batteries. Both were turned loose and
in a few minutes the boat was crippled and the pilot
headed for the shore. She was abandoned, and the
crew in wild dismay found refuge in the woods along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
the banks. The immediate trouble was that the
Confederates were on the opposite side from the
stranded steamer. In this crisis, a valiant Confederate,
Captain T. Gracy of the 3rd Kentucky, came to the
rescue, and although the water was chilling and the
current swift, he strapped his revolver around his neck,
mounted on a piece of driftwood, and with a board
for a paddle, propelled himself across the stream.
Keeping true to the instincts of the sailor, the pilot
refused to desert his care, and he surrendered to the
naked captain who had so bravely crossed the stream.
This was probably, in some respects, the richest capture
that Forrest had ever made, and his soldiers began to
unload the cargo and carry it away from the river bank
to a place where it might be watched and preserved
until it could be taken away.</p>

<p>The Federal gunboats got the range on the <em>Mazeppa</em>
and opened such a heavy fire that its new captors
were glad to consign the boat to the flames, while they
energetically packed and hauled its precious contents
to places so far inland that the guns of these sea fighters
could not find the places of hiding.</p>

<p>A little while and another large steamer, the <em>J. W.
Cheeseman</em>, approached the upper battery. It was
allowed to pass in between the two Confederate positions.
No sooner had she gone well into the trap than
fire was opened upon her, both from the troops upon
the shore, and from the artillery, and her officers were
glad to hasten the surrender of this splendid steamer.
The gunboat, <em>Undine</em>, had also gone in between the
batteries, but the Confederate artillery were not afraid
of gunboats, and so they pounded her so severely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
that she was disabled and driven to the shore, and her
crew and officers hastily abandoned her and escaped
through the woods, while she became a prize to Confederate
daring and marksmanship. In a little while,
the transport <em>Venus</em> moved up the river. On this boat
was a small detachment of Federal infantry. This boat
was attacked by Colonel Kelley and his men, and so
heavy was the iron hail upon her that she, too, was glad
to surrender and with the gunboat was brought safely
to the shore. Half the garrison were killed or wounded
and all captured.</p>

<p>On this day it seemed to rain gunboats. Another
one, the No. 29, had probably heard the firing, and,
coming down the river, anchored within half a mile
of the Confederate batteries and opened fire. This
was too slow a game for the Confederates, so General
Chalmers took the guns and his escort and a company
of videttes, and going through the cane and brush
got nearer to the gunboat and soon drove it away.
The steamboat <em>Cheeseman</em> could no longer be serviceable,
her stores were removed and flames lapped up
what was left of her. The <em>Venus</em> and the <em>Undine</em> were
slightly injured. The <em>Undine</em> was one of the largest
gunboats that had been sent up the Tennessee river.
She carried eight twenty-four pound guns, and when
she became a victim to Confederate courage, her entire
armament went with her. Her crew attempted to
spike the guns, but in this they were unsuccessful.
In all these captures the Confederate loss was one man
severely wounded. Five or six Federals were killed
on the <em>Venus</em>, three killed and four wounded on the
<em>Undine</em> and one wounded on the <em>Cheeseman</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>General Forrest, ever resourceful, and whose capacity
for all phases of war seemed unlimited, determined
to begin a career as a naval officer, and from the cavalry
a volunteer crew was made up; two twenty-four
pounders were placed on the <em>Venus</em>, and Captain
Gracy placed in command. Gracy had shown himself
to be a great land fighter, but he was yet to make his
reputation as a marine. The captured gunboat was
also put into commission. The new commodore was
directed to steam his boat up the river toward Johnsonville,
a few miles away, while the troops marched
along the road parallel to the river. The gunboats
were put in charge of Colonel Dawson. He evidently
did not want to secure Forrest’s ill will, and so he made
a covenant with him that if he lost his fleet, Forrest
was not to “cuss” him. The boats got separated.
The artillery were not skilled so well on water as they
were on land, and so when a Federal commodore, with
boats No. 32 and 29, got within range of the <em>Venus</em>,
they soon damaged her so badly that she was of no
service, and was run ashore and abandoned without
even setting on fire. The <em>Undine</em>, seeing the disaster
to her companion ship, sought safety on the river bank
under the protection of the Confederate batteries. The
Federal gunboat soon closed in upon the <em>Undine</em>, and it
was necessary to abandon her, also, and set her on fire.</p>

<p>So far General Forrest had inflicted a great amount
of damage upon the Federals. He had captured the
<em>Mazeppa</em> with seven hundred tons of freight, two other
steamboats, two other gunboats, the transports <em>Venus</em>
and <em>Cheeseman</em>, and another steamer over at Clarksville
on the Cumberland was also destroyed. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
not very far, something like twenty-five miles, across
to the Cumberland, and Forrest undertook to operate
upon both rivers. Johnsonville was on the east side
of the river.</p>

<p>On the 3rd day of November, Forrest reached the
scene of action with his chief of artillery, John W.
Morton. Johnsonville, at this time, appeared as a
sort of heavenly resort, or a Commissary Utopia, to the
Confederates, and Forrest promptly undertook its
destruction and all that was gathered in it. The landing
was filled with transports and barges and gunboats.
The great problem with the Confederates in the later
periods of the war was something to eat, wear, shoot
and ride, and the little town beside the Tennessee,
with more supplies than these oftentimes hungry and
illy clad horsemen had ever dreamed of, appeared to
contain all the provisions in the world. On the banks
were houses filled to overflowing with valuable supplies,
and acres of army stores were piled around the warehouses.
A new battery had come up during the following
night, under Captain Thrall. This was placed just
above the town, while the Morton and Hudson batteries
were placed just opposite and below the town.
At two o’clock Forrest opened with his artillery. He
had kept his movements so well concealed that the
Federals at Johnsonville were unaware of his presence
until the Confederate guns announced the presence of
an enemy. Morton promptly opened fire upon the
forts and gunboats. For a little while the Federals
had no apprehension that Forrest could effect very
much, but Morton, always skillful, soon obtained the
range and by cutting the fuses with precision, he put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
his shells into the midst of the supply station. Flame
and smoke soon began to rise from many of the boats
that lined the river, and from the goods along the wharf
and the warehouses. By nightfall, the boats and the
walls of the commissary were fired, and for three-quarters
of a mile up and down, the river presented a great
forest of flame. Flames illuminated the horizon for
miles and huge volumes of smoke rose up towards the
heavens in glorious signals of a great consuming fire.
Some said that the Federal soldiers fired their own boats.
Morton, Thrall, Bugg, Zaring, Brown and Hunter, the
men who directed the artillery firing on this expedition,
won splendid laurels by the accuracy of their aim.
Colonel Rucker had an extended experience in artillery
service in the Mississippi in the earlier stages of the
war; while General Lyon, who before his resignation
from the United States Army had served as an artillery
officer, gave their assistance in the important work of
destroying the Federal boats and supplies. The
artillery were the chief instruments in this crowning
act of destruction, and all others in the other corps were
glad to give them due praise and plaudits for the splendid
way in which they had performed their part in
this magnificent victory.</p>

<p>Forrest had now accomplished all he had come to
do. He had burned up millions’ worth of property.
The Federals said he had thirteen thousand men with
twenty-six guns. Sherman, telegraphing General
Grant, said, “That devil, Forrest, was down about
Johnsonville, making havoc among the gunboats and
transports.”</p>

<p>The roads had become well-nigh impassable, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
the return march to Corinth was slow and toilsome.
On November 10th, however, he arrived at Corinth in
reasonably good order. He had been absent a little
more than two weeks. He had captured and destroyed
four gunboats, fourteen transports, twenty barges,
twenty-six pieces of artillery, and six million seven
hundred thousand dollars’ worth of property. One
thing that particularly pleased the Confederates was
the capture of nine thousand pairs of shoes and one
thousand blankets, and strange to say, in all these
operations and fourteen days’ fighting of the Confederates,
two were killed and nine wounded.</p>

<p>Forrest always was able to mystify his enemies.
He had left enough troops in the neighborhood of
Memphis to keep the commanders there busy and to
fear an attack on the place. General Smith reported
from Memphis, on the 16th of October, that the houses
had been loop-holed for sharpshooters, and an inner
line of cotton defenses constructed, and told his commander
that Forrest was at Grenada on the Friday
night before. Halleck, in Washington, wired Thomas
that Forrest was threatening Memphis. General
Sherman was so alarmed by this destruction of Johnsonville
that he telegraphed to General Grant, saying,
“Sherman estimates that Forrest has 26,000 men
mounted and menacing his communications.” The
23rd Corps was despatched to Johnsonville, and up at
Columbus, Kentucky, Sherman had given orders
that guns must be defended to death and the town
should be burned rather than that Forrest should get
a pound of provisions. The Federals seemed to be
doing more telegraphing than fighting and marching.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
While they were comforting each other or alarming
each other, Forrest’s soldiers, well dressed, well mounted,
thoroughly equipped, were pulling through the mud,
trying to get out of Tennessee. The mud and slush
became such a menace that General Forrest was required
to use sixteen oxen to pull one gun. The teams
were doubled to carry the cannon, sixteen horses were
hitched to a single piece. The oxen would haul the
guns ten or fifteen miles and then were turned back to
their owners, who were allowed to drive them home.</p>

<p>On the 15th day of November, Forrest reached
Iuka, and then by rail from Cherokee Station, Forrest
and his men were transferred to Florence, Alabama.
On this trip, horseshoes and nails became very scarce.
Many times Forrest was compelled to take the tires
from the farm wagons along the route and have these
forged into shoes and nails for the use of the horses.</p>

<p>This marvelous expedition was to close the really
great destructive career of General Forrest. The ink
was hardly dry upon his letter to General Dick Taylor,
detailing a portion of the work under his command,
until orders were given for General Forrest to proceed
at once to Florence and there take command of the
cavalry of the Army of the Tennessee, under General
Hood.</p>

<p>It was a sad mistake when the Confederate Government
at Richmond had failed, a year before, to invest
General Forrest with command of the cavalry of the
Army of the Tennessee. He was not braver than General
Wheeler; he was not more patriotic than General
Wheeler; but without any reflection, it may be confidently
said that from the same number of men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
General Forrest would get more fighting than any officer
of the Confederate Army, General Lee not excepted.
When damage to his enemies was to be calculated
Forrest had no superior in the world. He captured and
destroyed more Federal military property than any
other officer of the war.</p>

<p>Forrest, like Wheeler, always went to the front.
Both seemed destined by miraculous interposition to be
preserved from death. Many times all those about
them went down before the enemy’s fire. Both Forrest
and Wheeler were several times injured, but never
very seriously. No two men were more reckless or
courageous on the battlefield, and no two men with the
means at their command ever did more for any cause
than Forrest and Wheeler. Of these two men many
thousands of pages might be written, and yet much
would be left unsaid that ought to be said in recounting
their wonderful campaigns. With charmed lives, with
brave spirits, with courageous souls and intrepid
hearts, they seemed immune from death.</p>

CAVALRY EXPEDITION OF THE TEXANS<br>
INTO NEW MEXICO, WINTER, 1861-62</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">Only three rivers escape from the American
Desert—the Columbia, Colorado and Rio
Grande. The last of these, the Rio Grande,
rises far up amid the mountains of Colorado, close to
the Montana line. It was named by the Spaniards Rio
Grande del Norte, or Grand River of the North, because
of its great length. It was sometimes called
Rio Bravo del Norte, “Brave River of the North.”
Fighting its way amid mountain gorges, through canyons,
cutting channels deep down into rocky defiles,
it forces a passage over nature’s fiercest obstacles and
drives its currents through New Mexico and Colorado
for seven hundred miles. Then turning southwardly,
it seeks a resting place in the waters of the Gulf of
Mexico. For more than eleven hundred miles it is the
boundary between Mexico and the United States.</p>

<p>Moved by love of conquest, or desire to spread the
gospel, the Spaniards followed the meandering course
of the stream for hundreds of miles, overcoming the
barriers which nature had placed in the pathway of
those who sought to conquer the arid and inhospitable
wilderness, through which this great stream passed to
its union with the far off sea. Navigable for only four
hundred and fifty miles from the ocean, it held out no
hope to those who might seek an easy way to its source.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
The great trail which led from the settlements on the
Atlantic to the new-found lands on the Pacific required
the travelers to pass the Rio Grande near Santa Fe.
There was no chance to start at El Paso and travel
northward by the Rio Grande to the heart of New Mexico
and thence find an outlet to the Pacific Ocean.
The men who pushed from the East to the Golden Gate
preferred to mark out a line from the Missouri River,
overland from Missouri, Kansas and Colorado, the
Indian Territory and New Mexico. A southern trail
might have been shorter, but mountains intervened and
nature forced men to make their highway for wagon
trains by Santa Fe from the East. The pioneer spirit
was strongest in the Missouri Valley, and the population
on the Mississippi was content to let those farther
north pursue the passage to the Pacific by the northern
route. A thin line of settlements had been established
along the trail, but no large population was willing then
to endure the hardships which surrounded those who
lived in those isolated regions; and the white men
refused to pass southward by the Rio Grande or the
Mexican border, for the country was so inhospitable
that it held out no inducements to emigration, commerce
or settlement.</p>

<p>When the war between the states began to stir the
hearts of the people of the South, after a brief delay,
Texas, that great empire with more than two hundred
and sixty-six thousand square miles, but thinly populated
area, caught the patriotic spirit of the hour, and
cast herself, body and soul, into the struggle of the
Southland for liberty and independence.</p>

<p>In February, 1861, an ordinance of secession was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
passed, and nine years later Texas was re-admitted to
the Union. General H. H. Sibley, a native of Louisiana,
resigned from the United States Army and entered the
service of the Confederate States. Familiar with the
geography of New Mexico, he visited Richmond,
Virginia, was commissioned brigadier general and
returned to Texas with authority to lead a brigade
up the Rio Grande to Santa Fe. Few believed, at that
early date, that war would last a year, and one of the
reasons impelling this expedition was to possess as
much territory as possible, so that when hostilities
ceased, the territories of the Confederacy would cover
the largest possible space. General Sibley reached San
Antonio, where the troops raised to compose his command
were being mustered in. A statement of his
plans aroused the zeal and enthusiasm of those who
were to engage in the adventure.</p>

<p>The conquest of New Mexico appeared feasible
and important. It would cut in twain the land route
between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and by reason
of its supposed strategic importance, prove of tremendous
value to the Confederate states.</p>

<p>The project was bold, daring, but illy considered,
and in the end, while sustained by heroism and courage
that certainly has no superior in the great story of
Southern manhood, yet proved a most unfortunate and
distressing failure. From El Paso, on the extreme western
boundary of Texas, to Santa Fe, by the route
along the Rio Grande, was something like six hundred
miles. The Santa Fe railroad of later days has rendered
this journey easy and pleasant, but in 1861-62,
the route was a vast wilderness, not producing enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
food to sustain the sparse number of people who had
settled along this trail. Venomous reptiles hid themselves
in the recesses of the sandy and rocky ways, or
laid in wait for their victims amidst the numerous
crevices that marked every mile. The very shrubbery
seemed to defy the advance of civilization, and the
thorns and thistles that stood out on every bush appeared
to enter fierce protests against habitation by
man or beast.</p>

<p>In the earlier days of the war, before experience had
made men deliberate, and to sit down and count the
cost ere entering upon any great military enterprise, it
was only necessary for someone to cry “Forward!” and
chivalrous patriots were ready to follow wherever any
leader might bid them go. The 4th, 5th and 7th
Texas mounted regiments were mustered into the Confederate
service for three years, or during the Civil War.
This enlistment took place October, 1861. Colonel
James Riley commanded the 4th. Later, at the head
of his regiment, he met a soldier’s death in Louisiana.
Thomas Green became colonel of the 5th, and William
Steele, colonel of the 7th Regiment. These formed a
brigade under the command of Brigadier General
H. H. Sibley. Steele did not go with his regiment,
which was led by Lieutenant Colonel J. S. Sutton, who
died heroically while leading his men at the Battle of
Val Verde near Fort Craig. Later, General Thomas
Green was promoted to the rank of brigadier general.
These regiments reorganized, then became known as
Green’s Brigade. When the true story of the war
shall be fitly told, the world will realize that no men
who marched under the stars and bars did more to win<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
the admiration and applause of the entire Southland
than those who composed this wonderful organization.</p>

<p>At this early period of the war, arms were scarce.
The fruits of victory had not then given Federal equipments
to Texas, and these soldiers were supplied with
shotguns and hunting rifles of varying calibre and necessitating
the preparation of each man’s ammunition by
himself. Many of these volunteers had mingled with
the Mexicans and heard their stories of the fiery charges
of the Mexican Lancers and of the deadly execution
which they made with their shafted spears, and following,
unwisely, the suggestions of General Sibley, two
companies of the 5th Regiment were induced to exchange
their guns for that medieval arm, the Mexican
lance.</p>

<p>The troops were enlisted and sworn in at San Antonio,
and before beginning the most difficult part of
their journey up the Rio Grande, marched from San
Antonio to El Paso, seven hundred miles, in broken
detachments. At this point, the government had
accumulated a small supply of commissary stores.
Between San Antonio and Santa Fe, there was not a
town or village which could have furnished, from its
own storage, a full day’s supply of rations and forage
for the command. The settlements were not only few
in number, but very far apart, and with small populations.
It thus came about that the troops were compelled
to carry rations for the whole march. These
were very meagre, and were transported in wagons
drawn by small Mexican mules. Meat was provided
through beeves that were driven on foot. No forage
of any kind was to be had other than the grass which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
grew upon the plains. As if to make the journey still
more difficult, water was extremely scarce; and many
parts of the journey, both men and beasts were compelled
to go on as long as thirty-six hours before relieving
their thirst. The men carried a day’s supply
in their canteens, but the poor beasts had no provision
for quenching the burning of their fevered throats.
There was not then living in the entire territory from
El Paso to Santa Fe as many as three hundred sincere
Southern sympathizers. The great majority of the
population were poor, illiterate Mexicans, who had a
traditional hatred of all Texans. The secession of
Texas from Mexico in 1835, the Santa Fe expedition
in 1841 and the war between the United States and
Mexico in 1846, had planted in the minds of these
rude frontiersmen bitter memories of the Texans.</p>

<p>Almost everywhere, without exception, this brigade,
when leaving El Paso and ascending the great river,
found itself in a hostile country, a country so devoid
of food that it was hardly able to maintain its own
people from want, and which with great difficulty
supplied them with the bare necessities of life. To
make this journey still more difficult for the Confederates,
General Canby, then and later on, showing
himself to be a wise and sagacious officer, had already,
by force or purchase, secured for the support of the
Federal troops whatever the needs of these poor people
could spare.</p>

<p>Most of the great marches of the war, made by
cavalry, were through countries that could at least
supply food for a few hours for man and beast. None
of them undertook to haul their commissary stores<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
six hundred miles or to rely upon beef driven afoot to
satisfy their hunger. The great passion of the brigade
was to be led forward. They had gone too far to return
without a fight and were anxious to find somebody to
engage in conflict. Practically no preparations had
been made to arrange for the wants of the soldiers.
No foresight had provided stores where food might be
garnered, nor wells dug, from which water, that greatest
essential of long marches, might be supplied. The
brigade finally composing this expedition consisted
of the 4th and 5th and part of the 7th Texas mounted
infantry, five companies of Baylor’s Regiment, Tool’s
light battery and Coopwood’s independent company,
aggregating twenty-five hundred men. One-sixth of
all these men were required for the protection of the
supply train and herd of beeves, and therefore could
not be relied upon in case of battle.</p>

<p>General Canby, through couriers, had full notice
of the coming expedition and its purpose, and he was
not slow to avail himself of the topographical as well
as the physical condition of the country in preparing
for the emergency. About a hundred and fifty miles
north of El Paso, on the river, Fort Craig had been
constructed, years before, by the United States Government.
The fortification was situated on the west bank
of the stream and within musket range of the only road
leading from El Paso to Santa Fe. Here General
Canby had concentrated over four thousand troops,
regulars and volunteers, including infantry, artillery
and cavalry, with supplies of every kind in abundance.
As the Confederates could travel only one road, the
Federal general had only to sit down and wait and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
prepare for their coming and had ample time to obstruct
the narrow pathway along which they must
reach Santa Fe. This march was undertaken in the
midst of winter. Those who led and those who followed
seemed to feel that an hour’s time was of the
most tremendous importance, and neither want of
preparation or danger could deter them from pushing
on to some point where they might meet a foe. Zeal
and haste to fight was universal with the southern
soldiers in the earlier days of the struggle. Without
any disparagement of their splendid courage under
all conditions, it may be safely said that a few months’
experience greatly lessened the intensity of this feeling.</p>

<p>Beyond Santa Fe, in the northeastern part of the
territory, another fortification, called Fort Union, had
been built before the war. This Post had been reconstructed
and manned, and here again were established
large depots of supplies. Troops had come down
from Colorado, and the United States regulars had been
hurried hither, and still farther, from the West, the
war-trumpets had called volunteers from California
who were hastening en route to the scene of hostilities.</p>

<p>A march so carelessly considered and so inadequately
provided for, with weather becoming cold,
demanded most strenuous sacrifices from the devoted
Texans who were engaged in this hazardous task.
The Confederates had no tents, their clothing supply
was confined to the uniforms that each wore, there was
no covering at night except their saddle blankets, and
yet, while the fierceness of the climate and the illy
provided commissary spread disease and death among
them, these gallant Confederates went pushing forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
with what would seem to thinking men but little
hope, yet without fear. It was not long until disease
began to grapple with its gaunt fingers numbers of
these chivalrous men. Pneumonia attacked many of
the advancing heroes, and under such conditions rarely
allowed any of its victims to escape with life.</p>

<p>By the 10th of February, 1862, the command came
in sight of Fort Craig. Surveys and reconnaissance
soon convinced even the inexperienced that the capture
of the Fort by direct assault would be practically
impossible, and that it would be equally impossible
to follow the road which the Fort commanded, and to
run such a gauntlet simply meant great decimation,
if not destruction of the entire command. A council
of war determined that the wise thing was to turn the
Fort by crossing to the east bank of the Rio Grande and
to march by it to a point called Val Verde (Green
Valley), some nine miles above Fort Craig. To carry
out this plan required a tremendous amount of courage
and endurance, for there was no road nor even a broken
trail, and this way was almost impassable for wagons.
It had never been traveled, but lay across deep and
wide gulleys and over steep sand hills. There was not
a single foot of made highway and men and animals,
beset by poisonous thorns, which infested well-nigh
every vegetable growth, and tramping over loose stones
which rendered almost every resting place for their
feet insecure, struggled, stumbled and toiled over the
arduous way that the exigencies of the hour forced
them to follow. After such laborious, depressing and
dangerous effort, two days later, on the evening of the
20th, the command had reached a point nearly opposite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>Fort Craig, only seven miles from their starting place
on the 19th. Here the weary troopers, wearier mules
and the thirsty cattle were encamped for the night.
The beasts had no water; the men only such as their
canteens contained. The conditions were enough to
cower the hearts of any soldiers and to dampen the
ardor of any patriot, but everybody realized that the
very desperate conditions must be met by supreme
valor.</p>

<p>Long before the sun had risen above the mountain
tops to illuminate and brighten the plains with its
cheering beams, the march was begun, so as to reach,
at the earliest moment possible, the river, at some point
above Fort Craig, and begin the advance again upon
the traveled highway, which, while rough, was delightful
in comparison to the two days’ march along the inhospitable
ground over which these brave soldiers had,
with uncomplaining fortitude, forced their way during
the past forty-eight hours. The Federal commander
did not sit still in the fort. Thoroughly advised of this
movement on the part of the Confederates, he pushed
his forces north along the road and when the advance
guard of the Confederates reached the river, their
enemy was there to dispute its passage. To provide
against loss of the cattle driven on foot, upon which
they depended for meat, and for the protection of the
commissary train, a considerable portion of the Confederate
force was detailed. The very desperation of
the situation stirred the hearts of the Confederates
with the noblest courage. Only about two thousand
fighting men were left available, after details were provided
for the protection of the cattle and the train.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
These had been left behind at the camp from which
they had marched out in the morning to force the battle.
There was nothing for the Confederates to do but to
win. The Federals were not averse to fighting, and so
they crossed the river with thirty-eight hundred men,
including a battery of six-pounders and two twenty-pounders.
A force sufficiently large to protect Fort
Craig against the assault had been left within its walls.
These two thousand Confederates, hungry and thirsty,
were to oppose, in a position chosen by the Federal
commander, a force nearly twice as large as their own.
With a fierceness born of difficulty and of courage
quickened by the unpropitious surroundings, the conflict
was short, sharp and decisive. The Federals were
driven back into the fort, with considerable loss of
officers and men, and their six-gun battery was captured
by the Confederates. The casualties on the
Confederate side in this Battle of Val Verde were less
than those of the Federals, but it included in the list
several of the most promising and prominent officers,
who, at this time, were sorely needed. Colonel Green,
who commanded the 5th Regiment, owing to the illness
of General Sibley, was in immediate charge of the
forces. He was a cheerful and experienced soldier,
and was later to demonstrate such great genius as a
commander, that when he died in April, 1864, at Blair’s
Landing, La., it was said of him by the Federal generals
that the ablest man west of the Mississippi had been
lost to the Southern cause.</p>

<hr class="blank">

<p>While the battle had been won and the enemy
driven back to the fort, it was not decisive; the Federals
were safe in the fort, and the Confederates, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>their small number of fighting men, were not sufficiently
strong, nor did they have the necessary ammunition to
carry the fort by assault. The little Confederate army
was not in condition to sit down and hesitate and argue
or even to delay action, and a council of war determined
that the wisest thing to do was to push on to
Santa Fe, in the hope of inducing the enemy at Fort
Craig to follow along the trail, come out into the open
and risk the issue of another contact.</p>

<p>The desperate condition of the Confederates was
apparent to any well-informed military man, and General
Canby, with an army at Fort Craig twice as large
as that of the Confederates, with a still larger force at
Fort Union, northeast from Santa Fe, all well supplied
with food and ammunition, decided that he had only
to bide his time and wait. He perfectly understood the
character of the country, the antagonism of the people
to the Confederate cause, and the limited resources
for providing maintenance for man or beast. He knew
the exact number of the Confederate command. He
understood they would be unable to carry out the
Confederate plan and closely calculated the difficulties
which awaited these brave men, who seemingly violating
the laws of prudence and ignoring caution,
were pushing themselves forward without support,
apparently indifferent to consequences.</p>

<p>In possession of Fort Craig, south of Santa Fe, and
Fort Union, north of Santa Fe, defending the well-known
and traveled north and south roads, which
were the only passable exits from the territory, with
troops which largely outnumbered his foes, half of
whom were regulars, tried, well equipped and exceeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
Confederates four thousand in numbers, the Federal
commander foresaw that the end could not be very far
off and that waiting was the wise and sagacious course
to pursue. No one needed to tell him that the Confederates
could have no hope of reinforcements. His
spies had already assured him of their meager supplies,
the vast number of sick and of the many graves along
the road of the Confederate march. These told him
that disease and hunger would be efficient allies, and
that only a few weeks could possibly intervene before
the Confederates would be compelled to abandon the
territory, and most probably be forced by want and
starvation to surrender as prisoners of war. With a
force twice as large as their own behind them and with
a force twice as large in front of them, with only one
traveled route along which they could pass, and that
totally inadequate for the supply of food for the invading
Confederates, the condition of these brave men
became almost desperate. Though the conditions were
so discouraging, General Sibley and his subordinates
advanced to Albuquerque and Santa Fe and took
possession of the immediate towns and villages.</p>

<p>On the 20th day of March, about sixteen miles
north of Santa Fe, a second battle occurred in Glorietta
Canyon. Here the worn Confederates came in contact
with Federal troops which had been sent forward from
Fort Union. The Confederates held possession of the
field of battle, but something worse than loss of men
had occurred. On account of the smallness of the force,
a sufficient rear guard had not been detailed for the protection
of the wagon train, and their entire supplies
had been captured by an attack of the Federal forces.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
While the Federal soldiers had been defeated and fell
back to Fort Union, and the Confederates returned to
Santa Fe, hunger was now staring these brave invaders
in the face. They were not afraid of their enemies,
but lack of food, ammunition and other necessities,
oftentimes more terrible than bullets, rarely fails to
strike terror into the hearts of the bravest soldiers.</p>

<p>The situation had been thoroughly tried out, the
Confederates had now been reduced to less than two
thousand men. They were practically destitute of
provisions and ammunition. One regiment had been
dismounted, its horses were reduced, not only in flesh
but in number, and so, some walking and some riding,
but all still stout at heart, these Confederates now prepared
to abandon the territory for which they had risked
and suffered so much. In a few days, the retreat to
El Paso was begun. Leaving strong forces at Fort
Union and Craig to protect them from any possible
force the Confederates could bring to their assault, all
available Union soldiers were rushed forward to contest
the retreat of General Sibley and his men, and to
cut off every avenue of escape. The only thing General
Canby failed to fully comprehend was the supreme
courage and valor of his foes, the intrepidity and skill of
their leaders, and the capacity of men and officers for
fatigue and their readiness, if needs be, to die, rather
than surrender as prisoners of war to their enemies.</p>

<p>Officers and men all understood the gravity of the
situation. They realized that safety lay not only in
retreat, but to escape at all necessitated the co-operation
and courage of every survivor of the depleted
command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>At Peralto, a small town on the Rio Grande, below
Albuquerque, the Confederates occupied the town,
but before them in battle array were six thousand
Federals, well armed, and this was the numerical
problem that faced the tired, half-clad and brave men
of the South. There was not the slightest disposition
to yield or run away, and so all day long the Confederates,
with their ill-equipped forces, calmly awaited the
attack of the Federals. But there was something the
men who were following the stars and bars feared more
than the men in blue—starvation. This was now their
most dreaded enemy, and this, accompanied by the
weather conditions, made a combination that would
strike terror into the heart of any ordinary man.</p>

<p>Along the Rio Grande River, the temperature
arises during the day to a hundred degrees and then by
midnight, it has dropped sixty degrees, alternating
between summer’s heat and winter’s frost. These
climatic changes shatter even the rocks that so greatly
abound in this dreary region and accompanied by lack
of warm and necessary clothing, depleted the energies
of the Confederates, but at the same time it stirred
them to renewed activities.</p>

<p>There was only one feasible route open to the
retreating invaders. This was down the Rio Grande,
and across this single path was a Union army numbering
more than three times those who essayed to escape.
The Confederates forded from the east bank to the
west side of the river, and for several days, both forces,
Union and Confederate, marched southward along the
stream on opposite sides. Now and then they exchanged
shots. It was soon discovered that to avoid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
an engagement, which the Confederates were not
prepared to risk, something must be done to escape the
presence of the enemy, so superior in numbers, food
and equipments. The thought of capture aroused the
hearts of all the men to heroic resolve to do and dare
all that was possible to avoid the humiliation and misfortune
of a surrender.</p>

<p>From out of the conflict one thing had been brought,
and these brave men were desirous of bearing this back
to Texas so that the great march should not be without
one trophy, and like grim death they hung to the six-gun
battery of twelve-pounders that they had captured
at Val Verde, a short while before. They were to haul
these cannon over the wilds safety had forced them to
traverse. They were to push and pull them to the crest
of hills to find that they could only be lowered with
ropes to the depths below, and each hour of suffering
and companionship with the mute and inanimate guns
would add renewed purpose to save them, if their
saving was to be compassed by human determination
and indomitable will.</p>

<p>In this campaign Joseph D. Sayers came to the
front. He was destined to play a distinguished part
in the war, and later in the history of Texas.</p>

<p>When the battery was captured at Val Verde, young
Sayers was not twenty-one years of age. His cheerfulness
under trial, his valor and dauntless courage
attracted the attention of the leaders, and he was designated
by common consent captain of the battery which
held so dear a place in the hearts of all who survived this
expedition. He had enjoyed a brief season at a military
school, but he was a born soldier. He was authorized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
to select the members for the battery and with them he
clung to the guns with bulldog tenacity, and brought
them safely through the dangers that ever loomed up
on the homeward march.</p>

<p>Captain Sayers, while in command of the battery,
was severely wounded at Bisland, Louisiana; and also
at Mansfield, Louisiana, while serving on General
Green’s staff with the rank of major. At General
Green’s death the young officer crossed the Mississippi
River with General Dick Taylor, upon whose staff he
served until his surrender in Mississippi in April, 1865.</p>

<p>On every field and in every sphere he met the highest
calls of a patriotic service and when paroled had won
the commendation and admiration of those who
fought with him. His war experiences fitted him for a
splendid civil career. He became lieutenant governor,
and later governor of Texas. He served fourteen years
in Congress, and when he voluntarily retired, his
associates in the House of Representatives passed a
resolution declaring that his leaving Congress was a
national rather than a party calamity. Amongst
Confederates, his career in the trans-Mississippi, and
later in the cis-Mississippi armies, gave him universal
respect, and the good opinion of the great state of Texas
was manifested in the bestowal of every honor to which
he aspired.</p>

<p>He still lives, in 1914, at Austin, and there is no one
who loves the South but that hopes for lengthened
years to the hero of Val Verde.</p>

<p>Councils of war were called, and it was resolved to
leave the river, march inland, over mountains and canyons
and through forests that had never been trodden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
by civilized man. The Spaniard, whether stirred by
religion or love of gold or gain, had never ventured to
traverse the country through which General Green and
his men now undertook to march. Half-clad, nearly
starved, footsore, with both nature and men rising up
to oppose their escape, without water sometimes for
two days, except what was carried in their canteens,
they hazarded this perilous journey. Trees and vines
and shrubbery with poisonous thorns stood in their
pathway. With axes and knives, they hewed them
down, and boldly and fearlessly plunged into the wilderness
to escape their pursuing and aggressive foes.
Over this rough, thorny road they traveled for one
hundred and fifty miles; and then, guided largely by
the sun, moon and stars, and nature’s landmarks, they
reached the river highway along which they had
marched in the early winter and struck the Rio Grande,
some distance below Fort Craig. With exuberant joy,
they realized that they had left their enemies behind.
Nine long and dreary days had been consumed in this
horrible journey. Man and beast alike had suffered to
the very extreme of endurance. The average distance
for each twenty-four hours was sixteen and two-thirds
miles. Where the intrepid and exhausted column would
emerge, even the experienced and stout-hearted guide,
Major Coopwood, did not know. West, south, east, the
gallant band must search for a path, and down canyons,
over precipitous cliffs, where the eye of white men had
never penetrated, these gallant Texans, half starved and
consumed for many hours with the fierce and debilitating
burnings of thirst, hunted for a path which would
enable them to leave their enemies behind and miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
below emerge into the Rio Grande Valley, at a point
from which they could, unmolested, pursue their march
to El Paso.</p>

<p>One-fifth of their number had died in battle or from
wounds and sickness, and three-fourths of the survivors
marched into San Antonio on foot. Eight months had
passed since the journey was begun. More than three
men each day, from either wounds or on the battle
field or through disease, had gone down to death, and
along the march of twelve hundred miles, on an average
of every four miles beside this devious and suffering
road, was the grave of some comrade, to tell of the
ravages and sorrows of war.</p>

<p>Barring the battery which had been captured in the
earlier periods of the expedition, the brigade came back
empty handed, but the men who composed it brought
with them a spirit of courage, a quickened patriotism,
a self-reliance, a steadiness of purpose, and a conception
of war that was to make them one of the most distinguished
and successful organizations of the world’s
greatest war; and trained for future services and succeeding
triumphs and victories that would endear them
not only to the hearts of the people of Texas, but to all
who loved or fought for the independence of the South.</p>

<p>After a few months of rest, remounted and recruited,
this splendid command entered upon a new career of
active service, and through the campaigns of 1863 and
1864, they were to make honorable records for themselves;
at Bisland, Fordocho, Bortrich Bay, Lafourche,
Fort Butler, Donaldsville, Bourbeau; Opelousas, Mansfield,
Pleasant Hill, Blair’s Landing and Yellow Bayou.
At Blair’s Landing, General Green met the fate of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
chivalrous, patriotic commander, dying as he had
fought, with his face to the foe. He and his command
were second to no horsemen who were enlisted on the
Southern side. The sad and unfortunate experiences
of the march into New Mexico proved a great education
for these valiant and gallant soldiers. They have been
less fortunate than the cavalry commands east of the
Mississippi in having chroniclers to exploit their heroism,
yet in their splendid career they were never surpassed
in the best elements of the cavalry soldier, by
any of those whose fame as champions of the Southland
and defenders of its glory and its honor has gone out
into the whole world.</p>

GENERAL J. E. B. STUART’S RIDE AROUND<br>
McCLELLAN’S ARMY—CHICKAHOMINY<br>
RAID, JUNE 12-15, 1863</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">General J. E. B. Stuart was born on the
16th of February, 1833. At the commencement
of the war he had just passed his twenty-eighth
year. His father had been an officer in the War of 1812.
He was born in Patrick County, Virginia, a few miles
away from the North Carolina line. In his veins there
was the richest mingling of Virginia’s best blood. In
1850 he was appointed a cadet at West Point, and
graduated thirteenth in a class of forty-six. At West
Point he was not a very great scholar, but an extremely
good soldier. He had a splendid physique, and was
popular wherever he went. In his early youth he had
hesitated between the law and war, and finally concluded
to remain in the army. He was commissioned
as second lieutenant in 1854 and served in Texas. He
saw a great deal of active service in Indian warfare and
in the early part of 1861 was at Fort Lyon. On the
7th of May, 1861, he reached Wytheville, Virginia.
His resignation was accepted by the War Department
on that day and he offered his sword to his native state.
On the 10th of May he was made lieutenant colonel of
infantry and directed to report to Colonel T. J. Jackson.
His commission was from the State of Virginia.
Sixty days later he was commissioned a colonel of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
Confederate cavalry, and on the 24th of September was
made brigadier general, and on July 25th, 1862, major
general.</p>

<p>General Stuart, in the summer and fall of 1861, was
busy on outpost duty, harassing the enemy and continually
active. His operations were not on any
extended scale.</p>

<p>General Joseph E. Johnston had a very high opinion
of General Stuart. As early as August 10th, 1861, he
had written to President Davis: “He—Stuart—is a
rare man, wonderfully endowed by nature with the
qualities necessary for light cavalry. If you had a
brigade of cavalry in this army, you could find no better
brigadier general to command.”</p>

<p>He took an important part in the Williamsburg
campaign, at the Battle of Williamsburg in May, 1862,
and at Seven Pines on the 31st of May and June 1st.
It was impossible at the last engagement to use cavalry,
but Stuart, always anxious and ready for a fight, was
only too happy to go to the front, and became General
Longstreet’s aide.</p>

<p>In March, 1862, McClellan had brought his Army
of the Potomac up to two hundred and twenty-two
thousand men, and with these undertook to capture
Richmond. He concluded it was wisest to take Richmond
from the rear and recommended that his forces
should be transferred to Fortress Monroe and he should
proceed from there in a northwesterly direction.</p>

<p>The forces under General Joseph E. Johnson and
later under General Lee were widely scattered. Some
of them were a hundred miles apart.</p>

<p>From the valleys of Virginia, and from Norfolk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
down through Fredericksburg, great armies were advancing
with Richmond as the converging point.
Stonewall Jackson had played havoc with McClellan’s
forces in the Shenandoah Valley, and had inaugurated
and won a campaign which brought him world-wide
fame. In three months Jackson had fought three
battles and marched five hundred miles, a feat which
was almost unsurpassed in the history of military movements.
He held a large Federal force over in the Valley.
This was at that period the most important factor in
the preservation of the armies of Joseph E. Johnston.</p>

<p>On the 16th of May, advancing from Fortress
Monroe, McClellan had taken possession of Whitehouse,
on the Pamunky River, and here established
his army and reached out to Seven Pines, within eight
miles of Richmond. It appeared now as if, with the
large forces at his command, McClellan would crush
Johnston and reach the coveted capital of the Confederacy.
Camped east and northeast of Richmond,
in a position chosen by himself, and to the acquisition
of which the Confederates made little resistance,
McClellan sat down to wait for the forty thousand
men McDowell was to bring through Fredericksburg
and unite with him in his present camp. The Confederates
were roughly handled by the Federals at
Hanover Court House on the 27th of May, and General
Joseph E. Johnston looked anxiously toward McDowell
at Fredericksburg, only fifty-two miles away. He resolved,
if possible, to crush McClellan before McDowell
could come to his assistance. On the 31st of May the
Battle of Seven Pines was fought. Brilliantly designed
by Johnston, he claimed that he only failed to destroy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
McClellan by the neglect of his subordinates to march
as directed. General Johnston was wounded on the
31st of May and was succeeded by General Gustavus W.
Smith, who commanded for a few hours. At two o’clock
on the 1st of June, President Davis rode out upon the
field with General Robert E. Lee and turned over to
him the command of the Army of Northern Virginia,
which he was to hold until the shadows of national
death overtook and overwhelmed Lee and his army at
Appomattox, on May 9th, 1865.</p>

<p>A large part of McClellan’s army was now south of
the Chickahominy River. It was extremely important
to know the situation of his forces. He was getting so
near to Richmond that the situation had become
intensely critical.</p>

<p>General Lee sent for General Stuart and in a private
interview explained that he desired to have full information
about the exact location of McClellan’s army.
On the 12th of June he despatched Stuart, with twelve
hundred of the best cavalry that the Army of Northern
Virginia could furnish, to ride round McClellan’s
camps and get full facts concerning their several locations
and movements. His ride on this errand is known
as the “Chickahominy Raid.”</p>

<p>Stuart did not wait a moment but instantly undertook
this perilous task. Prior to this time no great
cavalry raids had been made. Wheeler had not been
developed, and Morgan and Forrest had only short
forays to their credit. At this period Mosby had not
appeared in the Virginia campaigns which he was later
to brighten with many wonderful performances, but
rode with Stuart as his chief scout, guide and adviser,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
and no general ever had abler aid. Stuart and Mosby
were the same age, were men of like courage and dash,
between them was mutual admiration and affection,
and each believed implicitly in the genius of the other.</p>

<p>Stuart had been vigilant on outpost duty, but no one
had conceived so bold a move as to ride in the rear of a
great army of more than a hundred and twenty-five
thousand men at a time when the rivers crossing the
road were filled with the June rise. Figuratively taking
his life in his hand he cut loose from all communication
with his allies, and began the circuit of the opposing
army, which then stood north and east of Richmond.
It was a great work, requiring masterful genius, superb
skill, highest courage and transcendent faith in his
destiny. He was to make history in cavalry service,
set new standards and a new pace for horsemen in war.
The original letter which General Lee wrote to General
Stuart is still in existence. General Lee informed
General Stuart that his purpose was to get exact
intelligence of the enemy’s forces and fortifications,
to capture his forage parties and commissary depots and
as many guns and cattle as it was possible to bring away
with him, and to destroy, harass and intimidate the
wagon trains which were then supplying McClellan’s
army.</p>

<p>General Lee was not as full of confidence in Stuart’s
ability then as he was later. He cautioned Stuart
about going too far, staying too long, attempting too
much. He looked deeper into the situation than
Stuart possibly could. Twenty-six years more of life
and his lengthened military experience made him
cautious where Stuart would be reckless. It was well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
for Stuart that he was only twenty-nine years old.
Had he been fifty, he would have hesitated long before
undertaking such hazardous work. Faced by such
desperate odds, the youthful blood coursing with
unstinted forces through his veins, and his ambition
to wrest early from fame its highest rewards, subordinated
prudence and caution to the promptings of glory
and success, had faith that no odds could defeat
his plans and that misfortune was impossible where he
should go, with the chivalrous horsemen who would
follow in his lead.</p>

<p>It was easy to see that the primal object in General
Lee’s sending Stuart was to definitely locate the right
wing of McClellan’s army, to know how far it extended
east, and whether Jackson could be brought in strong
pressure upon it.</p>

<p>Justly Stuart was allowed to pick out his command.
He had a section of artillery. This was under Lieutenant
James Breathed. Wisely concluding that if you
do not want anybody to know your plans, you had
better not communicate them, Stuart told few of his
associate commanders his destination. The general
outlines of his expedition he communicated to Fitzhugh
Lee, W. H. F. Lee and W. T. Martin.</p>

<p>The first day’s march was not a heavy one, twenty-two
miles due north brought General Stuart to Taylorsville.
Having demonstrated that McClellan’s right
had not been extended east of a line north of Richmond,
General Stuart now turned due east and in a short
while marched southeast. He was singularly blessed
with scouts who had a full and complete knowledge
of the whole country. These had been despatched in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
various directions. It was beyond all things essential
for him to have accurate information regarding the
roads he was to travel. He began his movements at
early dawn. He had a great work before him; he was
to take a march of forty miles, the safety of which
depended upon the absolute watchfulness and the unfailing
vigilance of his troopers. The eye of every soldier
scanned the horizon. None knew aught of what was
ahead. Any instant might develop a cavalry or infantry
force across their pathway which would bar their
progress. No baggage delayed their speed. Stale
rations prepared before leaving would stay hunger
until they could pounce down upon a Federal wagon
train and take from their enemies the food necessary
to sustain them upon their strenuous ride. The best
horses had been provided for the artillery, so that it
could keep pace with the rapidly moving horsemen. A
rider was mounted on each of the animals attached to
the guns. It was necessary to move with extreme
rapidity, and all the preparations were made so that
nothing should delay or hinder the march.</p>

</figure>

<p>A force of Federal cavalry was found near Hanover
Court House. Failure to attack would indicate fear,
and so General Stuart ordered a charge. Fitzhugh
Lee had been sent south to intercept their retreat
toward McClellan’s army. The enemy moved south
of the Tunstall Station road, and Stuart concluded that
if they would let him alone he would let them alone.
A captured sergeant from the 6th United States Cavalry
showed that this force had been in position at Hanover
Court House. He had no time to pursue those who did
not pursue him, and taking a southeast course, almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>parallel with the Pamunky River, he spurred his
column to the highest possible speed. A Federal force
had been stationed at Old Church, which was on the
line of the road Stuart had determined to follow.
Moving with such great rapidity and with his presence
not expected, Stuart had no reason to believe that the
enemy would be able to know his purpose, his plans
and his place. A couple of squadrons of the 5th
United States Cavalry were stationed at Old Church.
A part of the duty of this command was to scout north
towards Hanover Court House. Observing Stuart’s
force, the lieutenant in command of one of these companies
saw the Confederate cavalry at eleven o’clock.
As he had only one company he estimated that the
Confederates had with them two squadrons of cavalry;
he concluded that he was not able to fight Stuart and
so he withdrew and avoided a conflict. Reporting
his observation to his superior officers, he was directed
to fall back upon the main body at Old Church. Stuart
was now ten miles north of the rear of McClellan’s
infantry. Numerous detachments of cavalry were
scattered about. It would not take long for couriers to
tell the story of Stuart’s presence and to estimate his
forces. Lieutenant Lee, who was in command of the
5th United States Cavalry, had now fallen back toward
the bridge at Totopotomy Creek, and he had resolved,
even though his command was small, to give Stuart
battle and test out the strength of the invader. The
bridge across the creek was intact. There was nothing
to do but fight. Captain Royal, who was in command
of the squadron, aligned his forces to receive Stuart’s
attack. Two of the companies of the 9th Virginia were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
sent to drive these Federals out of the way. The onset
was quick and furious. Captain Latane, of Company
F, of the 9th Virginia, rode to the charge. Royal was
severely wounded by Latane’s sabre, and Latane was
killed by Royal’s revolver. The Federal line was broken
and fell back. Discipline, however, asserted itself, and
although fleeing, they wheeled into line to receive the
second assault, and then Captain Royal left the field
to the Confederates. Quite a number of the 5th Cavalry
were captured, and there Fitzhugh Lee met many
acquaintances, pleased to come in contact with an officer
under whom they had served, even if he now wore the
gray. These men conversed freely with General Lee,
who was anxious to capture as many of the regiment as
possible. He received permission to follow the enemy
to Old Church and, if he could do so, make the entire
squadron prisoners. He captured the camp, but the
soldiers had fled.</p>

<p>At this time Stuart might have retraced his steps.
There was nothing to prevent his returning by the road
over which he had passed. Anxious to get the most
out of the expedition that was in it, although he had
told Fitzhugh Lee to follow the enemy back up the
road over which he had advanced, Lee now saw Stuart
turn and face southward. A less brave man would
have hesitated. Dangers awaited him upon every
mile. He was traveling southward and with this line
perils increased with every step of his trotting squadrons.
For a moment uncertainty filled his mind, but
it was only a moment, and then without an expression
of fear on his face or the feeling of a doubt in his heart,
he bade the column quicken its pace and into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
uncertainty of immeasurable and incalculable hazard
of a dangerous, unknown path, he hurled his little army.</p>

<p>Stuart now knew that the right wing of McClellan’s
army had not extended as far west as General Robert E.
Lee thought it had. It was important that General Lee
should have this information at the earliest possible
moment. One and a half days had been consumed in
coming. Should he go back, or should he make the
circuit of the Federal army, and endeavor to reach
General Lee south of the Chickahominy River? The
rivers in front and to the east were unfordable. He
must go north to find an easy way to escape and he
knew that the Federal infantry, south of him, was
within five miles of the road along which he must operate
to reach his starting point at Richmond. He must,
in the nature of the case, take the long road. His
attack on the 5th United States Cavalry had aroused
the enemy and his presence would be communicated
quickly to the Federals. These could hardly believe
that such a small force could be so far from home.
The daring of such a movement was incredible at this
period of the war. Later, many horsemen on both
sides would be glad—even anxious—to engage in such
an expedition. To General Stuart with any considerable
Confederate force belongs the credit of the inaugurating
such enterprises. Twenty-one days later General John
H. Morgan conceived and executed his first raid into
Kentucky and with twelve hundred men marched a
thousand miles in territory occupied by his foes. The
example of these two brilliant and successful commanders
would soon find many to follow their lead,
but to them belongs the credit of having successfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
demonstrated that possibility of such campaigns and
the practical safety of a cavalry force in such expeditions.</p>

<p>A Federal lieutenant reported that he had seen
infantry along with the cavalry, that he thought he
had counted as many as five regiments. Some put it
as high as seven regiments. The rumored presence of
infantry in their rear alarmed the Federals, who were
afraid that a large force had reached in behind them,
and so certain were the Federals of the presence of
infantry that General Porter directed General Cooke
not to attack the cavalry. This indecision on the part
of the Federals gave Stuart the advantage of several
hours. If he could pass Tunstall Station, twelve miles
away, he would have a wide territory in which to operate,
and in which the Federals would find it difficult
to ride him down. Fortune was extremely generous
and propitious. Numerous wagon trains were coming
along the road to Tunstall Station, carrying supplies
to McClellan’s army. The Pamunky River was the
base from which supplies were transported to McClellan.
It was navigable for quite a distance from the
Bay. Many trains were destroyed, two large transports
at Putney’s Ferry on the Pamunky River were
burned. The railroad from the Pamunky River to the
Chickahominy, under McClellan’s forces, had been
repaired. At White House, on the Pamunky, tremendous
quantities of supplies had been collected. This
was only four miles from Tunstall Station. Some gunboats
and six hundred cavalry protected this depot.
Stuart was now only five or six miles from McClellan’s
camp, and the cavalry and infantry might be despatched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
at any time to close the path he had chosen
for a return to Richmond. The idea suggested itself
to Stuart that he capture White House. He could have
done this, even with the small force under him, but
General Lee had told him he must not do all that he
might desire to do, and he refrained from attempting
this brilliant achievement. Cars, teams, sutlers’
stores, rations were destroyed, telegraph lines were
torn down, and from four o’clock in the evening until
darkness came on them, Stuart’s men were engaged in
the grim work of destruction. A company from New
Kent County composed part of the 3d Cavalry, and
Stuart had the advantage of having numbers of men
in his command who knew every path and by-way of
the country through which they must later pass.
This fact gave him great faith to ride away in safety
should Federal pressure become too tense. Detachments
were sent out in all directions to destroy as many
wagons as possible. The Chickahominy was full, but
it had fords. Eleven o’clock at night, and the last of
Stuart’s men had not left Tunstall Station. The Federal
infantry in large numbers began to arrive, and
some Pennsylvania cavalry as well. General Stuart
had calculated that he would cross at a ford near Forge
Bridge. This was ten miles from Tunstall’s. A young
lieutenant, who had most accurate knowledge of the
country, was confident the ford of which General Stuart
spoke would give a safe and easy passage over the river.
Alas, when the river was reached, new perplexities
arose and new dangers angrily stood out to thwart
Stuart’s plans. The rains had been more copious than
the guides had predicted or believed. The waters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
with pitiless currents rushing oceanwards, seemed to
forbid the passage of the Chickahominy. The storms,
which had raged two days before higher up the stream,
had widened the volumes of water, and to the imagination
of the wearied horsemen, these increased in width
every moment they stood upon its banks.</p>

<p>Colonel W. H. F. Lee was unwilling to surrender
the possibility of passing the stream at this point.
Boldly entering the water and swimming his horse he
reached the other side. The waters were so deep that
the horses’ feet became entangled in the roots of trees
and prevented a landing. These difficulties raised new
doubts and gave warning that some other ford must
be found, or means other than swimming must be
discovered for reaching the south bank. In this dire
extremity there was no hesitation or alarm and all
the gallant squadrons felt sure that fate, hitherto
gracious and helpful, would, in the crisis, come to their
rescue. Only heroes could be calm and cheerful under
these dispiriting conditions. Axes were hunted up and
trees were cut down in the hope that a temporary bridge
might be made, but the swift current, catching up the
trees, swept them down the stream like playthings
and made the labor of the horsemen a useless waste
of energy and time. In these moments, for a moment
now appeared hours, everybody seemed anxious except
General Stuart. It was important for General Lee to
know what Stuart had found out, and calling upon one
of his most trusted followers, he repeated in detail to
him what he had learned and bade him ride with all
haste and tell General Lee the story, and ask that an
advance be made on Charles City, to relieve his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
command of the difficulties with which they were
surrounded.</p>

<p>Every mind was now moved to the most vigorous
action. The imminence of danger quickened thought,
and to think must be to act. Someone under the pressure
of extreme peril remembered that an old bridge
one mile below had not been entirely destroyed. Hope
of escape quickened every step and with unreined and
highest speed, the troopers galloped to the site of the
ruined structure. Bents, stripped of girders, stood out
above the angry, muddy waters, but even they in their
desolation and isolation gave but scant promise of
escape. Warehouses close by, with the long planks
that enclosed their sides, were stripped of their covering.
Laid from bent to bent, they made a passway over
the stream, but they held out no means of crossing to
the weary steeds or offered no prospect to avoid a
plunge into the water. The tired beasts were unsaddled
and lashed and driven down the banks. Their masters,
bearing their equipments on their own backs, with
loosened bridle reins, walked along the narrow plankway,
while the horses, with their feet beating the water,
struggled in its turgid currents in their efforts to cross
to the opposite side.</p>

<p>While one part in ever-quickening haste thus convoyed
their mounts across, the other with renewed
energies strengthened the floors of the tottering bridge
and added braces to the timbers, which, under the
pressure, trembled and swayed and bade the men beware
lest they make too great calls upon the weakened
bents. Time, more time, was now the call. If money
could have enlarged minutes, every soldier would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
given all his possessions to win from Providence another
hour of freedom from pursuing foes. Stuart was
not willing to abandon his artillery. He had saved his
cavalry, but he did not want to give up his guns.
Orders for tearing more planks from the warehouse
and hunting longer and heavier lumber were sternly
and earnestly issued. Officers pleaded with the men
to rush, as they had never rushed before. They took
hold themselves. No rank stayed the exercise of every
man’s energies. With one-half of the command on the
south side and the other half on the north side, anxious
eyes, reinforced by brave yet questioning hearts,
watched with intensest eagerness the roads upon which
pursuing Federals might come. Attack now meant
capture or disaster. There was no escape, east or west.
The remnant on the north side might, if assailed, ride
through and over the attacking lines, but the artillery
could have no chance to run away, and scattered troops,
with their lines broken, would have but slender opportunities
of escape should they essay to ride back along
the roads they had so successfully and rapidly traversed
the two days before. Couriers, wires and scouts would
hunt out and reveal the lines of retreat and their
presence. Even the bravest hearts could evolve
naught but disaster, if the Federal cavalry should now,
when they were divided, force them to give battle.
Those on the south side had forty miles between them
and Richmond. To reach this goal they must pass
within a few miles of large numbers of McClellan’s
army. Whether the troops were on one side or the
other of the Chickahominy, the moment was full of
forebodings and presented difficulties calculated to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
make even the bravest of men fearful of what even an
instant might bring forth. Sharp eyes scanned the
roads along which the enemy might come. The crossway
was quickly patched and completed, and by one
o’clock the artillery was sent over. Strong, vigilant
rear guards had been stationed some distance away
from the bridge. Two or three times the enemy made
their appearance, but unwilling to show the least sign
of hesitation or doubt, these Federal forces were
vigorously attacked.</p>

<p>When the difficulties of the Chickahominy had been
surmounted, Stuart recognized that great tasks were
yet before him. He was forty miles from Richmond,
two-thirds of the distance lay within Federal lines. He
must follow the course of the James. His enemies
were between the James and the Chickahominy.
There was no other route for Stuart to travel. His
courage and his orders had brought him into the extremities
of the situation. A small force of infantry,
properly disposed, could cut off his escape, and he knew
nothing of what his enemies were doing to thwart his
plans and encompass his ruin. If he calculated the
dangers or doubted his courage and skill to meet all
emergencies, he would be overwhelmed with fear and
misgivings. Great legions of difficulties rose up before
his vision to disturb the quietude of his valiant soul.
With a wave of his hand and with a peaceful smile
upon his compressed lips, he bade fear begone. He
answered doubts and quieted them with the response
that the men who followed him never wavered at duty’s
call, and forward he moved, calm, serene, and with not
a shadow of distrust or misgiving hovering in his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span></p>

<p>Having used the bridge themselves, the torch was
applied with willing hands by the grateful troopers.
They might not abuse the bridge that had carried
them over, but they joyfully burned it lest it might
bear relentless enemies over to the side to which they
had so fortunately come by reason of its succor and
help in the hour of desperation and uncertainty. In
the gloaming of the evening, turned into flames, the
blazing timbers, so lately a rescue, rose up as a great
beacon light, which lit up the surrounding country.
If the Federals saw these flames, they understood that
the daring raider with his tireless followers had escaped
from Federal toils and was temporarily safe
from their assaults. A fordless stream now rolled
between them and the men they were pursuing.</p>

<p>From the highest point which he touched on Newfound
River to the lowest point touched on Queen’s
Creek, a tributary of the James River, was forty miles,
and from Richmond to the farthest point east, a short
distance from Tunstall Station, was only twenty
miles. From Richmond to the main force of McClellan’s
army was eight miles, and from the Chickahominy
to the Pamunky at Tunstall Station was twelve miles.
South of the Chickahominy, five miles, was the largest
force of the Federal army; north of it, at Cold Harbor,
was another strong division and then five miles east at
Ellyson’s Mill was another large infantry Federal force.</p>

<p>At Ellyson’s Mill, down the Chickahominy, to Cold
Harbor, at Fair Oaks, McClellan had infantry forces
practically covering the entire territory which Stuart
must pass. He traveled around the Federal army
one hundred and thirty miles, and at no point of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
whole journey was he removed from some Federal
force as much as five miles. With his small command,
at several places he was less than eight miles from large
infantry commands. The inexperience of the Federal
cavalry was one of Stuart’s chiefest aids in carrying
out his splendid conception of this brilliant march.
Two years later it would have been impossible even for
Stuart, with his seasoned and trained soldiers, to have
made such a movement. Stuart had knowledge of the
men who would oppose him, and particularly of the
cavalrymen who would pursue him, and this made him
calmer and more confident than he would otherwise
have been. No enemy came. The artillery was saved.
United on the south side of the stream, their delivery
from such imminent danger gave them renewed and
enlarged confidence. They did not know what was
ahead. The past was a sure guarantee of the future.
Hitherto they had come in safety, and they confidently
believed that fate would still be kind and helpful. The
very uncertainty of what might at any moment appear
to prevent their escape or impede their progress made
them brave and cheerful. They rode swiftly along
the road which might at any moment prove to be
thronged with vigilant foes. The close call at the
river, their triumph over apparently unsurmountable
difficulties, made them complacent and contented.
They pitied their weary and hungry beasts, and took
little account of what privations they themselves had
endured, or from what great danger they had so fortunately
been delivered. General Stuart might now
breathe easier, but he could not yet breathe freely.
On the James River, along the banks of which he must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
pass on his route to Richmond, were Federal gunboats;
and Hooker, from White Oak Swamps, five miles from
the only course that Stuart could follow, could within a
couple of hours, under forced marches, place infantry
in the front. There was no time for rest or food; a
splendid exploit, a magnificent expedition, was now
nearing completion, and no appeal of tired nature could
find response in the heart of the gallant leader. With
marvelous genius he had brought his men out of difficulties
that seemed unsurmountable, and so riding and
riding and riding through the long hours of the night
and the day, with ever-watchful eyes and ever-increasing
vigilance, he pursued his journey to reach the place
from which, four days before, he had set out upon what
was then the greatest cavalry expedition of the war.
He had lost one soldier, but he was a soldier worthy of
any cause. Captain Latane’s burial by lovely Southern
women, with the assistance of a faithful slave, has become
one of the most pathetic incidents of the war.
Aided only by the faithful negro, to whom freedom had
no charms when associated with the abandonment of
those he had served and loved, they dug a grave,
folded his pale, brave hands over his stilled heart, and
alone and without the protection of the men they loved,
they read the burial service for the dead and committed
the dust of the young patriot to the care of the
God they truly and sincerely worshipped.</p>

<p>Stuart had left behind him, even when pressed by
his enemies, but one artillery limber. From sunset until
eleven o’clock at night these fierce raiders and their
harried steeds slept. Awakened at midnight, by dawn
they reached Richmond. General Stuart turned over
the command of the brigade to Colonel Fitzhugh Lee,
near Charles City, at sunset on the night of the 14th,
and taking with him one courier and a guide, he hastily
rode to report to General Lee the result of his expedition.
Once during the night the wiry trooper stopped to
refresh himself with a cup of coffee. For twenty miles
of his journey he was liable at any turn in the road to
meet Federal scouts. The hours of the night were long.
Stuart both in body and mind had borne tremendous
burdens on his great march, but he felt more than repaid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
for all he had suffered and endured when, as the
sun rose over General Lee’s headquarters, with his two
faithful companions he dismounted to tell the great
chieftain what he and his men had accomplished. He
had captured one hundred and sixty-five prisoners and
brought them out with him. He had captured two
hundred and sixty horses and mules, which he was
enabled to turn over to the quartermaster’s department.
He had destroyed not less than seventy-five
wagons, two schooners and great quantities of forage,
and to the Federals more trains were lost than were
in the possession of the brigade quartermaster, at the
front, with McClellan’s great army.</p>

<p>This exploit gave General Stuart a leading place
among Confederate cavalry leaders, which he ably and
fully sustained until the end so sadly came to him at
Yellow Tavern, almost to an hour, two years later, in
his desperate defense of Richmond from the approach
of Sheridan and his raiders. He deserved all the world
said and thought about him. His genius, his daring,
his unfaltering courage, his cheerfulness and calmness
in danger stamped him as a military prodigy and gave
him a renown that would increase and brighten, as,
month by month, fate was yet to open for him the paths
of true greatness.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">General Meade, notwithstanding his splendid
service to the Federal Army at Gettysburg,
did not receive the promotion to which he and
many of his associates and friends felt that he was
entitled. In the fall of 1863 and in the early part of
1864 the failure of Meade to meet public expectation
induced President Lincoln to bring General Grant
from the West to direct the military movements
around Washington and Richmond. There had been
so many disappointments under the impetus of the
cry, “On to Richmond,” that General Grant determined,
as he said, “to make Lee’s army my only objective
point. Wherever Lee goes we will go and we
will hammer him continuously until by mere attrition,
if nothing else, there shall be nothing left him but
submission.” General Grant had many successes to
his credit, but he had never faced General Lee, and he
had not yet fully comprehended the character of the
foe he was to encounter in the new field to which he
had come. He had before him a gigantic task. It
required several great battles to awake General Grant
fully to the burdens he must carry in the mission he had,
with some degree of both egotism and optimism,
assumed.</p>

<p>These pronunciamentos of victory sounded well in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
orders and reports to his superiors. The rulers and
overseers in Washington were gladdened by these
expressions of confidence and assurance. True, many
here and there had thus spoken, but these had no
such history as General Grant, and could give no
such reasons as he for the hope that was within him.</p>

<p>During the first week of May, 1864, the roads and
conditions were such that an advance could be safely
made by the Federal forces. On the 2d of May General
Lee ascended a high mountain in the midst of his army
and with a glass took in the situation. Around and
about him were scenes which his genius had made
illustrious and which the men of his army, by their
valor, had rendered immortal. Longstreet had come
back from Tennessee and Georgia and the Army of
Northern Virginia had been recruited as far as possible,
so as to prepare for the onslaught which the springtime
would surely bring, and which the military conditions
rendered speedy and certain.</p>

<p>Grant’s forces were well down in Virginia near
Culpepper Court House, forty-five miles from Washington.
He had one hundred and fifty thousand men
under his command. This large army demanded vast
trains for supplies, and one-seventh of General Grant’s
army was required to take care of his wagon train.
Grant had two hundred and seventy-five cannon of the
most improved kind, and he had Sheridan, then in the
zenith of his fame, as his cavalry leader. There were
thirteen thousand cavalrymen to look out for the advance
and take care of the flanks of this great array.
It is calculated that if Grant’s supply train had marched
in single file, it would have covered a distance of one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
hundred miles; and one of General Grant’s well-informed
subordinates said to him, “You have the best
clothed and the best fed army that ever marched on
any field.”</p>

<p>About the first of May General Lee had sixty-two
thousand men ready for battle. He had two hundred
and twenty-five guns; five thousand artillerymen and
eight thousand five hundred cavalrymen under the
renowned “Jeb” Stuart. Each of the great leaders
realized, although they gave no outward expression of
their conclusion, that the month of May would witness
a mighty death grapple, the fiercest and most destructive
that the war had seen. Neither the men in gray
nor the men in blue would possibly have fought so
vigorously had they known what the days from May 4th
to June 4th had in store for the legions now ready to
face and destroy each other. Day by day the calls of an
astounding mortality would be met. Day by day each
would accept the demands that duty made, with a
fortitude that was worthy of American soldiers, but
only General Lee fully realized what these days would
bring forth. Not until twenty days later did General
Grant grasp the true extent of what this advance meant
to the soldiers he had been called to lead.</p>

<p>It was clear from General Grant’s telegrams that
he had not expected the sort of campaign that General
Lee put up against him in this march to Richmond.
On the 4th of May, after he had crossed the Rapidan,
he wired to his superiors at Washington that “forty-eight
hours would demonstrate whether Lee intends to
give battle before receding to Richmond.” General
Lee was in no hurry to throw down the gage. He could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
afford to take his own time. He had met many Federal
generals before and he had out-generaled them all.
His army was at Orange Court House. Later, to protect
his flank, it turned eastward to Spottsylvania
County. Gradually Lee was nestling his army between
Fredericksburg and the Pamunky River. Richmond
was almost due south of Washington, but the Potomac
drove Grant westward and in sight of Fredericksburg,
where in days gone by Burnside had been crushed.
Grant had resolved to go to Richmond, but between
him and Richmond was General Lee with his matchless
fighters, and hitherto these had proved an unsurmountable
barrier to all who undertook to travel this road.</p>

<p>By the morning of the 5th the lines had been
formed on the Wilderness Road and it became apparent
that every step that General Grant would take on his
southern advance was to be skillfully and savagely
contested.</p>

<p>On the 5th of May, when the first day of the battle
was passed, General Lee had suffered no reverse, and
he telegraphed to Richmond: “By the blessing of God
we maintained our position against every effort, until
night, when the contest closed.” By five o’clock on
the morning of the 6th the armies were engaged again.
In the midst of a crisis at the front, long expected reinforcements
came on the field; General Lee advanced
to meet them. The turning point was at hand. The
men of Texas were the first to reach the scene of action.
Hitherto General Lee had never lost his equipoise, and,
riding in the midst of the Texans, did what he rarely
ever did before—gave an immediate command on the
battlefield. He exclaimed to the Texans: “Charge!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
Charge! Charge, boys! Charge!” He was rushing
amongst them to the front where the storm of lead and
iron was heavy and momentarily increasing. When
these devoted soldiers saw their great commander
exposed to the fire, with one accord they cried out:
“Go back, General Lee! Go back! Go back!” The
brave artillerymen under Poague shouted, “Come back,
General Lee! Come back! Come back!” Oblivious of
these tender expressions of their solicitude, lifting himself
high up in his stirrups, on “Traveler,” and waving
his hat he headed the charge. Up to this moment there
had been no firing from the Confederate soldiers.
From one end of the line to the other there arose over
the battlefield the cry, “Lee to the rear! Lee to the
rear!” The roar of artillery and the sharper crackling
of musketry could not drown this outburst of solicitude
along the Confederate ranks. No danger could quell
this agony of his followers or still their fear for his
safety. His life was to them above all other considerations,
and their concern for him even in the midst of
greatest danger was an absorbing passion and consuming
desire. A brawny Texas sergeant sprang from the
ranks and seized the bridle of “Traveler” and turned
him about. The Confederate column refused to move
until General Lee retired from the scene of danger.
The love and devotion of his followers forced him to go.
No commander could, or dare, resist such an appeal.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 10th of May General Grant
felt that Washington would like to know what had
happened down in the Virginia hills, and so out of the
smoke and gloom of the firing line and the burning
summer sun he said: “We were engaged with the enemy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
all day both on the 5th and 6th.... Had there been
daylight, the enemy could have injured us very much
in the confusion that prevailed.” He confessed that
his loss in this battle had been twelve thousand. He
quieted the alarms at Washington by saying that the
mortality of the Confederates no doubt exceeded his,
but he admitted, that was only a guess based on the
fact that they had attacked and were repulsed. He
added: “At present we can claim no victory over the
enemy, neither have they gained a single advantage.”
General Grant had now discovered that General Lee
would give him battle “this side of Richmond,” and it
had cost him seventeen thousand men to reach this
conclusion.</p>

<p>By the 8th of May General Grant began to take
General Lee more seriously, for he wired: “It is not
demonstrated what the enemy will do, but the best of
feeling prevails in this army and I feel at present no
apprehension for the result.” He now resolved to go
east of the route he had chosen and so he despatched
the following to his superiors: “My exact route to the
James River I have not yet definitely marked out.”
It was evident that General Lee had changed General
Grant’s plans.</p>

<p>General Grant now set his cavalry to raid General
Lee’s trains. Sheridan swung to the right and struck
the highway to Richmond. The contending forces had
now reached Spottsylvania Court House. It had been
a slow march, and it was a death march. By the 10th
General Grant became still more uncertain, and he
wired: “The enemy hold out front in very strong force
and evince a very strong determination to interpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
between us and Richmond.... I shall take no backward
steps but may be compelled to send back for
further supplies. We can maintain ourselves and in
the end beat Lee’s army, I believe.”</p>

<p>On the 11th General Grant had still further reason
to revise his opinions. He wired General Halleck:
“We have now ended the 6th day of very heavy fighting.
The result to this time is in our favor, but our
losses have been heavy as well as those of the enemy.
We have lost to this time eleven ... general officers
killed, wounded and missing, and probably twenty
thousand men. I propose to fight it out on this line
if it takes all summer.”</p>

<p>Not sufficiently protected, twenty-eight hundred
of General Lee’s men had been captured. Artillery
had not been ordered to their support promptly enough,
and twenty cannon were the prize of Hancock’s valiant
followers. General Lee heard the sounds of a fierce
conflict and rode to the scene of danger and advanced
into a line of heavy fire. He found himself in the midst
of General John B. Gordon’s men. General Gordon,
with that voice that thrilled men in war and peace,
wherever it was heard, shouted: “General Lee to the
rear!” and flaming with courage and enthusiasm he
rode to the Confederate chieftain and exclaimed,
“General Lee, these men are Georgians and Virginians;
they have never failed you. They will not fail you
now.” A soldier, moved by the spirit of the moment,
rushed from the ranks and seizing “Traveler” by the
bridle turned his head to the rear and led him away,
and up and down the line came a mighty cry, “Lee to
the rear!” With a wild rush Gordon drove the enemy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
from his front, but not a step did the soldiers advance
until General Lee had obeyed their peremptory order
to find a place of safety.</p>

<p>General Lee, remaining close to the position where
Gordon had left him, attempted to lead the Mississippians
under Harris. These again took up the great
heart cry of the Confederate hosts, and shouted, “Lee
to the rear! Lee to the rear!” The conflict became
appalling. Men from opposite sides of breastworks
climbed to their tops and fired into the face of their
opponents. They grappled with each other and drew
each other across the breastworks. The trenches were
filled with blood, and nature sent a cold and dreary
rain to chill the life currents of the wounded men that
lay on the field. It was said by those who listened to
the sound of musketry and the crash of artillery at
Spottsylvania and elsewhere, that it was the steadiest
and most continuous and deafening that the war
witnessed.</p>

<p>By the 13th twenty-eight hundred of Lee’s men had
been captured under General Bushrod Johnson, but
he had only lost eighteen per cent of his army. Sixteen
thousand of General Grant’s had been killed and
wounded. To this loss must be added the twenty
thousand who had already fallen bravely before the
men of the Army of Northern Virginia.</p>

<p>By the 12th General Grant had telegraphed: “The
8th day of battle closed. The enemy obstinate. They
seem to have found the last ditch.” On the morning
of the 13th General Grant’s subordinate again telegraphed:
“The proportion of severely wounded is
greater than either of the previous day’s fighting.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
He further said in the afternoon: “The impression that
Lee had started on his retreat which prevailed at the
date of my despatch this morning is not confirmed....
Of course, we cannot determine without a battle whether
the whole army is still here, and nothing has been done
today to provoke one. It has been necessary to rest
the men, and accordingly we have everywhere stood
upon the defensive.”</p>

<p>It was on the evening of May 11th that along the
wires came to General Lee the startling and shocking
intelligence that General J. E. B. Stuart had
fallen. For seven days Lee declined to give any official
announcement of this tragedy. He carried the depressing
secret in his bosom. A year before, Stonewall
Jackson, at Chancellorsville, had been stricken down
in the midst of another gigantic conflict. General Lee
was unwilling to let his fighters know that death had
called the illustrious cavalry chieftain at the moment
when they most needed the inspiration of every Confederate
leader.</p>

<p>Grant sat down to wait five days and in the meantime
he added twenty thousand fresh troops to his
legions.</p>

<p>The hammering process had not proved such a
wonderful success after all, and so Grant had ordered
Sigel down the Shenandoah Valley to break Lee’s
communication. In the meantime General John C.
Breckinridge came up from Southwestern Virginia
and brought with him some infantry and some cavalry,
and on the 15th of May, while General Grant was
waiting, Breckinridge had crushed Sigel and captured
six of his guns as well as one-sixth of his men. On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
17th of May, Halleck wired General Grant: “Sigel is
in full retreat on Strasburg. He will do nothing but
run—never did anything else”; and there came also
to General Grant on this eventful day the news that
Beauregard over at Petersburg had driven General
Butler back and bottled him up on the James River.</p>

<p>On the 20th of May, Grant moved still further
eastward at Spottsylvania Court House. Since crossing
the Rapidan on May 4th, sixteen days before, he
had suffered a loss of thirty-seven thousand men.
This was thirty per cent of all the fighting men that he
had led out from Culpepper Court House.</p>

<p>Grant was still moving eastward and Dana telegraphed:
“Now for the first time Lee prevented his
southward march.” He seemed to have forgotten
what had been happening since the 4th of May.</p>

<p>Sigel disposed of, Breckinridge came to join in the
conflict at Cold Harbor. By the 26th of May General
Grant had withdrawn from Lee’s front, and pressing
eastward and southwardly, attempted to find another
road to Richmond. He telegraphed to Washington:
“I may be mistaken, but I feel that our success over
Lee’s army is already insured,” but yet he directed that
his supplies be brought up the Pamunky River to the
White House. He was looking for a base and he was
going to find the path that McClellan followed when he
met defeat from General Lee two years before.</p>

<p>By May 30th General Grant had again changed his
views about General Lee and so he despatched to
General Halleck: “I wish you would bring all the pontoon
bridging you can to City Point to have it ready
in case it is wanted.” He found out that Lee might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
fight outside of Richmond—and anywhere else in its
defense.</p>

<p>The two armies were swinging around now to Cold
Harbor. This place was already known in history.
The armies now facing each other had met there before,
in June, 1862. The results then to the Federals were
not encouraging. This time they were to prove far
more disastrous and exceedingly horrible.</p>

<p>On the morning of June 3d, 1864, at half past four
o’clock, General Grant opened a great battle—Cold
Harbor—the greatest battle of this campaign and the
only battle he afterwards said that he ever regretted
having fought. Persisting in his policy of forcing his
way south to Richmond, he was unwilling to confess
failure. Confident of the power of the “hammering
process,” committed by his boast to fight it out on this
line if it took all summer, he was too proud to admit
that he was mistaken. He hoped and believed that
fate, hitherto so propitious, would now come to his
rescue and relief in the extremity of the situation into
which war’s surprises had brought him. Between four
and nine o’clock in the morning, assault after assault
was made and the whole front of Grant’s line was so
decimated that his men drew back from the scenes of
conflict. At nine o’clock it became so dreadful that
even as brave men as Hancock refused to transmit
General Grant’s peremptory orders to his subordinates
to renew the attack. Each time it was transmitted,
each time the men on the line refused to obey the order,
and officers who had never before quailed, and who were
strangers to fear, stood still and allowed their men to
stand still in the face of peremptory orders to advance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
Ten thousand men on the 1st and 3d of June were
wounded and killed, and then General Grant moved
away from Lee’s front. It was impregnable, and General
Grant realized that the Army of Northern Virginia,
although only half as numerous as his own, would not
be driven away from their places. It cost thousands
of dead and wounded, but it was demonstrated to be
a verity, and General Grant, with all his hitherto
indomitable will and with his tremendous pride of
opinion, yielded to the inevitable—that General Lee’s
genius and the courage of his followers had forced into
his mind and set up in his path.</p>

<p>Seventeen thousand killed, wounded or sent away
by reason of sickness, were the tidings that came from
this ensanguined field to Washington, where thirty
days before every heart was so full of hope. General
Grant had permitted his dead and wounded between
the lines to lie uncared for until the 5th of June, and
then humanity with fearful protest forced him at least
officially to admit that he was vanquished. He at last
sought the right to succor the wounded and bury the
dead.</p>

<p>With the Army of Northern Virginia behind the
breastworks, with their courage and dogged determination
to defend their capital, there was no force of men
and no legion however brave or intrepid that could move
these men in gray. The men under the Stars and Bars
had sufficient ammunition to keep their guns in use, and
so long as it was possible to fire these guns, no earthly
foeman could break their lines. True, for an instant,
at one angle the line had been forced, but quickly it
was retaken and the Confederate front restored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span></p>

<p>Grant had lost approximately seventy thousand
men, killed or wounded. General Lee had suffered a
loss of twenty thousand, making a total on both sides of
ninety thousand, and from Culpepper to Cold Harbor,
covering a period of thirty days, the world had never
seen such a trail of blood. The life currents of valiant
soldiers flowed almost in a stream. These armies had
traveled fifty miles. They had been battling and killing
all the way. This road was two hundred and sixty-four
thousand feet in length. Every three feet had witnessed
the sacrifice of a life or the infliction of a wound.
Men looked aghast at this loss of life and limb.</p>

<p>On the 11th of May, General Stuart had fallen at
Yellow Tavern. He died on the 12th. Universal
sorrow filled every heart. A year before Stonewall
Jackson had died, and now came the death of Stuart,
as a sort of final stroke to the Confederate hopes.
When Stuart died, on May 12th, General Wade Hampton,
as senior major general of cavalry in the Army of
Northern Virginia, took his place. Sheridan had gone
down to the west of Richmond and made the attack
which resulted in Stuart’s death, and after a repulse
rode back to the shelter of General Grant’s infantry.</p>

<p>Sheridan had reached the gates of Richmond, but
there his course was stayed and his raid ended and he
turned about and came to the west of Grant’s army
and resumed his place with it on the 25th of May.
He had not suffered a very great loss, six hundred and
twenty-five men, but the Confederates had lost Stuart,
and now Hampton was to come to the front. He was
forty-six years of age; he had passed through three
years of vigorous warfare and a wide experience.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
Under him now were some of the best cavalry leaders
the country had known. He had M. C. Butler, with
his South Carolinians; he had P. M. B. Young, with
his Georgians; he had Rosser, with his Virginians;
he had Wickham and Lomax, with their Virginians,
under Fitzhugh Lee. He had James B. Gordon, with
the North Carolinians, and Chambliss, with his Virginians,
under W. H. F. Lee, son of Robert E. Lee.
Dismounts, wounds and casualties had reduced his
forces to the point where they could only do the necessary
cavalry work for General Lee’s army.</p>

<p>The Federal cavalry, at this time, was commanded
by General Sheridan. He had three divisions under
Torbert, Gregg and Wilson, and these had between
them fifteen thousand eight hundred and twenty-five
serviceable horses and men. For every horseman of
Hampton, Sheridan had two. A little while before
there had come into use among the Federals the
Spencer &amp; Hall magazine rifles. Each man not only
had one of these magazine rifles, but he had a revolver
and a sabre. The horses were always fed and they
could be changed whenever the exigencies of war
demanded. After the experiences at Fleetwood Hill,
General Hampton realized that the methods of fighting
must be altered. He had read of what Morgan and
Forrest and Wheeler had done with dismounted men.
He did not yield his mounted drill, but he expanded
and developed his dismounted drill.</p>

<p>General Grant had failed to break General Lee’s
lines. He must now resort to flank movements.
General Hampton never for a moment hesitated at the
tremendous responsibilities which now rested upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
cavalry. He was conscious of his power and the efficiency
of his followers, and was ready to do the best he
could. He was the successor of one of the most distinguished,
brave and dashing cavalry leaders of the war.
It required genius and courage to rise to the situation,
but General Hampton, with calmness and intrepidity,
was willing to meet every call and face every emergency.</p>

<p>Over at Hawes’ Shop, on the 28th of May, Sheridan
was trying to find out the position of the Confederate
infantry, and Hampton was trying to find out the position
of the Federal infantry. They fought seven hours.
Some of Hampton’s men had never heard the battle
sound before. They had been sandwiched in with the
veterans, and they made good soldiers even in their
first conflict.</p>

<p>Custer and other Federal officers said that the fight
at Hawes’ Shop was the severest cavalry fighting in the
war. Colonel Alger of the 5th Michigan says it was
a hand-to-hand battle. The South Carolinians bore
the brunt of it, and they won new laurels. When the
result of the fighting at Hawes’ Shop was made known
none doubted that Stuart’s mantle had fallen upon a
worthy successor. It was immediately preceding the
death of General Stuart that General Sheridan said
either to Grant or some of his commanders that he
“could whip hell out of Stuart”; to which General
Grant laconically replied, “Why in hell didn’t he go
and do it?” He went, but he came back without
making good his boast, and he was now to take a turn
with General Hampton.</p>

<p>Next came Atlee Station, with its close, sharp
contest and with its victory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span></p>

<p>After the Battle of Cold Harbor, on the 4th day of
June, Grant began to fortify and swing around to the
east and north. Later he crossed the James River
and sat down for the siege of Petersburg. He had not
at first recognized General Lee’s true greatness. Here
he was to realize the stern, unyielding courage of the
Army of Northern Virginia. He had found it would
do no good to “fight it out on that line, if it took all
summer,” and to save his army from annihilation he
must change his plan of campaign. At the Battle of
Cold Harbor, the ratio of loss had been for fifteen
Federals, one Confederate. Nothing had happened
like this before. No man could deny the valor and
persistency of the Federal soldiers under Grant. They
did not flinch when the test came. They bared their
breast to the awful storm, and it swept more than
seventy thousand either into the grave or the hospital.
We know now all that passed. The wonderful book
published by the Federal government, entitled “War
of the Rebellion, Official Record,” tells the whole story,
and the reader can see by the daily records and despatches
of the actors on both sides, in these days of
tremendous conflict, what these two armies did in the
gigantic struggle for the possession of the Confederate
capital.</p>

<p>On the morning of June 8th, General Hampton
with his forces was out near Atlee Station, eight miles
north of Richmond. In the early hours of that morning
Sheridan marched away with a cavalry force of
nine thousand men. He had been ordered by Grant
to march northwest, to capture and destroy Gordonsville
and Charlottesville, and then to move down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
valley and help Hunter, who was then on his way to
Lynchburg.</p>

<p>All the fury and storm of war now seemed to be
turned loose on General Lee’s army. Hunter had
penetrated the valley and was setting his face toward
Lynchburg. The torch, with the horrors of hell behind
it, was reducing the beautiful and happy homes of
Virginia to heaps of ruins; piles of ashes and chimneys
standing stark and lone were the memorial to the savagery
of the invasion of this once hospitable and cultured
country. Now Sheridan, later the “Scourge of
God” in the Shenandoah Valley, was to add new
atrocities at Charlottesville to war’s devastation and
brutality.</p>

<p>The signal stations told the story of General Sheridan’s
departure. General Hampton divined where he
was going. He conferred with General Lee, and asked
to follow Sheridan’s path and attempt the defense of
the valley. As greatly as General Lee needed men,
he could not allow Sheridan to march unmolested and
destroy lines which were so essential to the maintenance
of the Confederate position in and around
Richmond.</p>

<p>Rations were light in these days. Quickly, three
days’ food was cooked and with a few ears of corn tied
round with strings and fastened to the saddles became
the commissary equipment of Hampton’s forces,
which were to engage in one of the important cavalry
campaigns of the war. The cavalry under Hampton
and Sheridan was to be removed fifty miles from the
infantry supports and the cavalry alone was to fight
out the issues of this campaign. Like mighty wrestlers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
repairing to some desert to try out their skill alone,
these two cavalry forces marched away where none
could see them in their struggle, and where none could
come to the rescue of the vanquished.</p>

<p>Hampton could not take more than forty-seven
hundred men. These were all that Lee could spare.
He had twelve pieces of artillery.</p>

<p>Sheridan had two divisions. They numbered nine
thousand men. They carried twenty-four pieces of
artillery, and were the best the army of the Potomac
could send. Sheridan had the 1st, 2d and 5th United
States Regulars and there were no better trained cavalry
than these. He had Custer’s brigade, who had
imbibed the dash and courage of their leader, and he
had New York, New Jersey and Maine regiments that
had won renown not only at Fleetwood Hill, but on
many other fields. These horsemen had witnessed the
terrors of the march from Culpepper to Cold Harbor.
Its wrecks and its losses stood out before their minds
in sharpest lines. The horsemen had fared well, and
the infantry had borne the burden of the thirty-seven
days’ decimation, and with the instincts of brave men
they were rather glad to be sent to take a hand in any
movement which should either avenge or compensate
for the defense of that terrifying campaign.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/p407.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">GENERAL WADE HAMPTON</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Few people knew of Sheridan’s going. He had
marched away first towards Washington, but he could
not march out of sight of the skill or the watchful eyes
of General Hampton’s scouts. Hope beat high in the
breast of Sheridan. He had felt chagrined that he had
failed in his attack on Richmond a few days before and
now he hoped to destroy Gordonsville and Charlottesville
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>and march down the valley to Lynchburg and take
Richmond from the rear, come in behind Petersburg,
and bring wreck and ruin to General Lee. It was a
great plan of campaign, laid out along broad lines.
He had hoped to keep away from his wily antagonist,
but Hampton divined whither he was going, and it
turned out when Sheridan had reached the first objective
point of his campaign, he was to face a tired but
vigorous and dauntless pursuer, and one who never
quailed or doubted even when nature was almost
pitilessly resistant.</p>

<p>Sheridan marched in three days sixty-five miles.
It was hot, dusty and water was scarce. He marched
leisurely, because he felt that his antagonist knew
naught of his plans, and he was confident that Hampton
could not reach him where he was going. He was sure
that he had gotten away unobserved, and that he would
have nothing to do but burn, waste and destroy from
Gordonsville to Lynchburg. He could see in his mind’s
eye the flames licking up the buildings that stood by
the path he was to march. A feeling of profound
satisfaction filled his heart, and on the terribleness of
his work he felt sure he could found a new reputation
for victory and success.</p>

<p>On the night of the 10th Sheridan and his soldiers
slept calmly in the summer air. They did not know
where Hampton was, but they felt sure he was not
where they were, and no dreams of danger or battle
disturbed the tranquility and quiet of their rest.</p>

<p>On the morning after Sheridan started north and
then turned west, Hampton set his forces in motion.
He was sure that he knew where Sheridan was going.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
He was staking his all on the correctness of his instincts.
He was confident he could march more rapidly than
Sheridan; he knew the road and he had the short line;
but yet he must march under tremendous difficulties.
The temperature was torrid, the dust was so thick
that it almost could be cut with a knife. After breathing
it a few hours, the nostrils and eyes of the men
became inflamed, and the moisture of the body combining
with the dust made an oozy, slimy substance
that half blinded their vision. Water was scarce and
food was scarce, but courage was still abundant.</p>

<p>By the night of June 10th Hampton had traveled
something like fifty miles. Sheridan had gone sixty-five
miles, and as darkness came on, Hampton’s forces
reached Green Spring Valley, a few miles away from
Trevilian Station, an insignificant railway stop, from
which the battle on the morrow was to take its name.
The two Confederate divisions were a few miles apart.
This hard marching, the cooked rations, the corn upon
the saddles, told the intelligent men that constituted
Hampton’s forces that they were after somebody and
it did not take them long to figure out that this somebody
was Sheridan. With their parched throats and
swollen eyes, and suffering with inflamed nostrils, they
laid down to sleep, not worrying about the morrow.
Careless as to what it would bring for them, they were
ready to answer every call of duty, wherever that should
lead them in the day to come. As the streaks of light
began to come over the mountain sides from the east,
every man in the Confederate line was up and at his
post, ready for action. The last of the corn that was
brought on their weary backs from Atlee Station was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
fed to the hungry brutes, and the last of the soggy
bread, which had been cooked for the men before they
had set out on this march, was eaten. General Hampton
knew that now he must be close to the Federal lines.
The night before his scouts had brought him back
information that Sheridan was near by. Some of
these had looked into his camps, and the Federals,
unconscious of the presence of Hampton’s legions,
had been sounding their bugles and were quietly and
leisurely making their morning’s meal. They felt
there was no need for haste. As there was no hostile
force near, they believed they might in safety enjoy a
brief repose, which they had fully earned by hardest
service.</p>

<p>Hampton’s scouts knew the topography. They had
described Sheridan’s location. He formed his plans
accordingly, and they were plans which involved
savage work. General Forrest’s quaint saying, “Get
the bulge on them,” had traveled to the east and fallen
on Hampton’s ears. With an inferior force he well
understood that strategy and skill would stand him
well in hand, and that he must take fullest advantage
of all that chance might send his way. It was worth
some hundreds of men to get the drop on Sheridan.
The first lick is oftentimes of great value, and General
Hampton was resolved if it was possible to strike an
unexpected blow. He hoped in this way to equalize
the disparity of numbers. He began his work early
and he set about the business of the day furiously.
His orders were to assail the enemy wherever and whenever
found and not for a single moment to stay the
tide of battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span></p>

<p>The country had not been denuded of its wood.
This would help to hide from the enemy the full strength
and position of the Confederates, and at the same time
it would make more effective the slower, steadier and
more accurate firing of the men in gray. The Federals
had sarcastically referred to General Hampton as a
“woods fighter”; in other words, he was afraid to
come out in the open, but when he had forty-seven
hundred to nine thousand, he had a right to take advantage
of all that the surrounding conditions would
give him in the conflict.</p>

<p>Hampton had undertaken to intercept Sheridan’s
march. He had out-marched him. He had done in
two days that which had taken Sheridan three, and
his men were as fresh and bright as those of Sheridan.
The journey had told on man and beast, but they had
both become used to the severest toil, and were willing
and ready for any fray that would pass that way.</p>

<p>Some picket firing was heard, but the Federals,
not yet realizing that Hampton was in their front and
on their flank, supposed that the desultory shots were
from the guns of raw militia who had pressed forward
with more vigor than discretion.</p>

<p>Sheridan and his most dashing lieutenant, General
Custer, no sooner heard heavy firing than they comprehended
the real situation. They understood that
the Confederates had followed them in heavy force,
that the clash would be serious, and that hard fighting
was at hand, and that if they were to continue their
march down the valley, they must discomfit the men
who were now assailing their lines and drive them out
of their path. The Federals began to fight back with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
spirit. It did not take them long to get ready for the
grave task that was forced upon them. While the
Confederates were charging, the men in blue were
charging, too, and by good luck and by boldness Custer
passed between Fitzhugh Lee and Hampton’s two
divisions and was at the Confederate rear before anybody
caught on to this serious condition. When
General Hampton, guided by the sound of firing,
rushed to the spot, he found that Custer was vigorously
assailing his rear. Custer had taken many of his caissons
and wagons and led horses, and he felt that victory
was already within his grasp. In this emergency,
Rosser, who could always be depended upon for a
fierce, impetuous charge, was ordered to attack Custer.
In a few moments the crash of charging horses, the
roll of revolver firing, and the cuts of sabres demonstrated
to Custer’s men that the people they were
fighting were not militia, but foemen worthy of their
steel. Nearly all that Custer had captured was retaken,
and an entire regiment made prisoners. Rosser
fell wounded. The enemy, finding the opportunity,
pressed hard upon Butler’s and Young’s brigades.
The result of the battle hung in the balance. A mistake
on either side would be fatal. Hampton’s presence was
always an inspiration, and he rode from place to place
on every part of the field. Outnumbered, Hampton’s
division under Lee was sorely pressed, and General
Fitzhugh Lee’s division was cut off and became so
thoroughly separated that it could be of no help or
support for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Sheridan’s forces were now turned with severe
impact upon Hampton’s division, and gradually it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
forced back toward Gordonsville, but still protected
that place and Charlottesville. Hampton quickly
took advantage of a railroad embankment, dismounted
his men and put them behind it, and against this,
Sheridan, all during the afternoon of the 10th, in vain
hurled his forces. When the sun rose on the morning
of the 11th, Hampton, his men, his artillery and his
horses were still in position. Sheridan, strangely
enough, waited until three o’clock in the afternoon.
By this he lost his chance to win. Had he rushed the
Confederate line with a real impetuous assault he would
have broken it. He waited without a good reason.
Fitzhugh Lee, with two-fifths of Hampton’s men,
was marching to avoid Federal interruption, and when
he came, Hampton’s heart was gladdened and his hopes
lifted high. Fitzhugh Lee coming once more united
the Confederates, and now all of Hampton’s men faced
all of Sheridan’s men with Hampton protected by the
railroad embankment. When this barrier, as the battle
front was lengthened, failed, fence rails were pressed
into service and such earth as the men could throw
up with their hands and plates and cups reinforced the
rails. So far little had been done or accomplished, and
Sheridan moved up his men close to the Confederate
lines. They had plenty of ammunition, and the roar
from the constant discharge of the magazine rifles made
a terrific din. Again and again Sheridan’s men with
supreme courage assailed the Confederate breastworks,
but each time they left their dead and wounded and fell
back from the scenes of slaughter. Chew and Hart,
with their artillery, poured deadliest discharges into
the Federal columns. At one time General M. C.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
Butler’s men exhausted their ammunition. It looked
as if all was lost. When despair seemed to fill every
heart in this brave command, an ammunition wagon,
with the horses lashed to a gallop, came dashing by,
and the occupants of the wagon flung out from its
sides loose handfuls of cartridges, and these the men
joyously seized and returned to the fray. Seven times
Sheridan’s men advanced to the charge, and seven times
they recoiled from the tremendous fire that greeted
them from the Confederate lines. At the moment
of the last assault a Confederate shell exploded a
Federal caisson. Somebody realized that this was the
psychological moment, and from over the breastworks
the Confederates, moved by instinct and valor,
charged with the speed of racers upon the Federal line.
The rebel yell was heard from end to end, and the Federal
forces, disheartened by their many failures, were
swept away by the unexpected and impetuous advance
of Hampton’s soldiers. The turning point had come.
The Confederates seized their opportunity and the
battle was won.</p>

<p>From three o’clock in the afternoon until ten
o’clock at night the contest had raged, and the record
showed that it was a fierce contest. Both sides had
dismounted. On the ground they were assailing each
other with greatest energy and persistence. The Confederates
had the best of position, but the Federals had
the most of men. All through the afternoon and in
the darkness of night neither side was willing to give
up the struggle. The stars came out with feeble light
to relieve the gloom and shadows that overspread the
wreck and suffering of the battlefield. Naught could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
stay the surging tide of war, and in the darkness, as in
the light, these soldiers continued to wage the contest.
There was no time to bear away the dead or relieve
the wounded. Orders had been given by General
Hampton to Fitzhugh Lee for rapid and fierce pursuit,
and to intervene between Sheridan and Carpenter’s
Ford on the North Anna River, at which he had crossed
the day before; but the orders failed or were not executed
and Sheridan marched away, leaving the unfortunate
wounded behind, and returned by the same
road over which he had come. He left in the hands
of the men of the South six hundred and ninety-five
prisoners and one hundred and twenty-five wounded.
Again was demonstrated the power of the single-firing
guns. The Federals claim to have carried away more
than five hundred wounded, but they abandoned their
dead and a hundred and twenty-five wounded were
left with Hampton.</p>

<p>Little time was allowed for expressions of humanity.
The Confederates, with the possession of the battlefield,
assumed thereby responsibility for the care of those
whose misfortunes left them suffering and helpless in
the fields and woods that had witnessed the harvest
of death on the two days of the struggle. When the
storm of battle had passed, Federal and Confederate
wounded were placed in improvised hospitals constructed
of flat cars, thence conveyed to some convenient
hospital further south. The few people that
were left in this war-stricken country brought such food
as they could spare to feed Hampton and his men;
but these, rising to the highest calls of humanity,
hungry and thirsty themselves, willingly made an equal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
division of what had been brought with their wounded
and captured foes. This was a splendid demonstration
of the noble and generous instincts that ever dwell in
the hearts of brave men and which quicken and expand
under the influence of opportunity. The bitterness
of a fratricidal war could not stay the exercise of benignity
and mercy.</p>

<p>General Sheridan endeavored to mitigate the unfortunate
results of this expedition upon which he had
started with high and boastful hopes. He had promised
so much and accomplished so little that it required no
small genius and much of rhetorical skill to satisfy
those who had sent him on so important a mission.
He had his own choice of troopers. Those he took with
him had shown that in any contest they were ready
to give a good account of themselves. Equipped,
armed and provided with all that money could bring,
and brought to a high degree of discipline, and already
fully proved as able to cope with their foes, General
Sheridan had either to exaggerate the number of men
under Hampton, magnify the difficulties he encountered
or admit a complete defeat. He chose the former.
He claimed that he had attacked the Confederates in
fortifications. He reported that Hampton had been
reinforced by infantry on the second day of the fight,
when in fact there was no infantry closer than General
Lee’s camps, eight miles from Richmond. The barren
results of this expedition temporarily shook General
Grant’s faith in General Sheridan’s capacity and fighting
qualities, and this was only restored, when later,
in the Valley and around Petersburg, General Sheridan
repaired his shattered reputation, and with the experiences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
of another four months demonstrated that he
was both a brilliant and aggressive cavalry leader.</p>

<p>He had hoped to do great damage to the railroad at
Gordonsville and south to Staunton, and yet he only
disturbed two hundred feet. General Torbert reported
that the Confederates had a large brigade of mounted
infantry armed with rifle muskets. A Federal prisoner
had written in his diary on the last day of the fight—“Sunday,
June 12th, ... fought on same ground and
got whipped like the devil....” Anyhow, whatever
may have been the results as figured in General
Sheridan’s imagination, he made a night ride, crossed
the North Anna River, and marched back to Cold
Harbor, from whence he had come. For eight days
Hampton was on one side of the river and Sheridan
on the other. If Sheridan wanted to fight he had pontoon
bridges and he had only to lay them and cross
over. For at least a portion of the time the two cavalry
commands were within sight of each other and now
and then they exchanged shots. After fifteen days
General Sheridan had gotten back to where he left
Grant’s army, from whence he started out with such
flattering hopes and alluring expectations. He now
found that Grant had determined to abandon his summer
line, cross the Chickahominy, ferry over the
James River, and take up a position on its south bank,
from whence the long siege of Petersburg would begin,
and proceed by inches until it would culminate in the
overthrow of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>General Hampton had a second chance at General
Gregg at Nance’s Shop on the 24th of June, eleven days
after the cessation of hostilities at Trevilian. He came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
close to making a complete rout of General Gregg’s
forces. Attacking in the afternoon he harried his
lines,—pursued him until eleven o’clock at night, and
a short distance from Charles City Court House
captured one hundred and fifty-seven prisoners. So
sorely was General Gregg’s division handled in this
affair that it required some time to recruit and
mend up.</p>

<p>General Sheridan, in making his report, was bound
by his backward march to express his regret at his
inability to carry out his instructions. It was with much
humiliation that he admitted failure. In the campaign
Sheridan lost, according to Federal reports, more than
fifteen hundred killed, wounded and taken prisoner,
while General Hampton’s forces lost less than eight
hundred. This Trevilian expedition was another test
out of the spirit and power of Federal and Confederate
cavalry of the armies in Northern Virginia. It demonstrated
anew that the Confederate cavalry under
Hampton was just as enterprising, as valiant, as
enthusiastic and as brave and dauntless as when it
fought under Stuart. Down to the very end the horsemen
of the Army of Northern Virginia maintained
their proud spirit and their indomitable will, and when
the last call was made, when the lines at Petersburg
had been broken, and when General Lee, in the vain
hope of effecting a union with Johnston in Georgia,
had turned his face west and reached Appomattox,
there to be met with sad and appalling disaster, the
cavalry was still ready and willing to fight and give
valiant response to the last call that their country
could make upon their fealty and their courage. Many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
of them marched into North Carolina and Georgia to
make one more stand under the Stars and Bars, and
once more offer their lives to win life for the Confederate
Nation.</p>

MORGAN’S RIDE AROUND CINCINNATI, ON<br>
“THE OHIO RAID,” JULY, 1863</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">In June, 1863, General Banks was hammering Port
Hudson, Louisiana, where General Gardner, the
commander of the Confederate forces, made such
gallant and fierce resistance. The fall of Vicksburg on
July 4th did not affect the valor of Gardner and his
command. He fought until his men from mere exhaustion
could fight no longer. Without rest, in constant
battle for six weeks, flesh and blood could resist
no more. He inflicted tremendous loss upon his assailants,
and he yielded only when further resistance was
physically impossible. These were very dark days for
the people of the Southland.</p>

<p>After the Battle of Murfreesboro at Stone River,
December 31, 1862—January 1, 1863, General Rosecrans
remained inactive for five months. The mortality
in this struggle measurably paralyzed the energies
of both Confederates and Federals. Each general sat
down to rest, renew hopes, recuperate and plead for
reinforcements.</p>

<p>While Rosecrans had behind him almost unlimited
resources, an ample fighting force of trained men and
abundant supplies, the experience at Murfreesboro rendered
him uncertain about grappling again with General
Bragg, and the latter, with the awful memory of that
struggle, was glad to wait for the other side to move.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span></p>

<p>That, in June, 1863, Bragg’s troops were at Shelbyville,
Tennessee, about twenty miles away from Murfreesboro,
was convincing evidence that Rosecrans was
not eager for battle. The clamors of those in authority
at Washington indicated that Rosecrans must advance.
It was necessary for him either to go forward or resign,
and in June he undertook to force Bragg still farther
south.</p>

<p>Fifty miles from Nashville, at Shelbyville, General
Bragg decided again to try the fortunes of war, but
Rosecrans, with a larger army than Bragg, was able
to turn his flanks. On the 27th of June General Bragg
concentrated his army at Tullahoma, which was
twenty miles from Shelbyville. He had at first determined
there again to risk a battle. At this time,
General Bragg was in extremely poor health. With
friction among his generals and with enemies in front,
he had suffered both mental and physical depletion,
and General Hardee had said of him that he “was not
able to take command in the field.” His corps commanders
advised him to recede and retreat to Chattanooga,
where with his army he arrived on the 7th of
July, 1863. The spirit and courage of his men had
suffered no depreciation. He had lost no guns and no
supplies, and the rank and file had no sympathy in the
movements which surrendered so much of Tennessee
to Federal occupation. A third of Bragg’s army were
Tennesseeans, and they looked upon a retreat to Chattanooga
as little short of treason. Left to these men
thus expatriated by military necessities, they would
gladly have fought a battle every week.</p>

<p>Determined upon another trial of strength with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
Rosecrans, General Bragg undertook, through General
John H. Morgan, to threaten and destroy the Federal
lines of communication, to force the withdrawal of men
to defend wagon trains, railroad bridges and trestles.
Morgan was directed to enter Kentucky at or near
Burksville on the Cumberland River, proceed northward
to the Ohio River, and then retreat out of the
state by the route which the exigencies of the moment
should suggest as the most feasible road for a return
to the army in Tennessee. For some days previous
General Morgan’s division had been concentrating in
Wayne County, Kentucky, in and around Monticello,
its county seat, and he gradually worked his way
towards Burksville. Across the Cumberland, Federal
cavalry were guarding the paths into Central Kentucky
and keeping a sharp lookout for Morgan and his
followers. They had stringent orders to be vigilant
and under no stress to allow the Confederate raider
to steal by and start havoc and ruin on the Louisville &amp;
Nashville Railroad, then essential for feeding Rosecrans’
advancing legions.</p>

<p>Here, waiting for the moment which would be most
critical in General Bragg’s southward retreat, on the
morning of July 2d, 1863, General Morgan’s division,
twenty-six hundred strong, crossed the Cumberland
River at Burksville and at Turkey Neck Bend, a few
miles west of the town. Nine-tenths of the men composing
this division were Kentuckians and all very
young men. A thrill of joy stirred every heart and
quickened every body, when the order came which
turned their faces homeward. The men of Missouri,
Maryland and Kentucky were the orphans of the Confederacy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
and to them home-going in army days gave a
touch of highest bliss. The First Brigade, under General
Duke, crossed a short distance above Burksville, while
the Second Brigade, under General Adam R. Johnson,
crossed at Turkey Neck Bend, a few miles below Burksville,
some five or six miles apart. The First Brigade
had some flat boats, and the Second had one leaky
flatboat and a couple of canoes. All the horses and some
of the men of the Second Brigade must swim. There
was no organized resistance to the crossing of the
stream, which was full from bank to bank and its
currents running at tremendous speed. The Federal
watchers thought the great flood in the Cumberland
River would temporarily stop Morgan, and with the
water on their side, they did not believe it possible for
the Confederates to pass over with their artillery and
ammunition and get lodgment on the north side of the
stream. They could not learn exactly where he would
try to ferry; they knew he could not ford, and so,
trusting to luck and high water, they securely waited
in their camp for what the morrow would bring forth.</p>

<p>In the Second Brigade the saddles, guns, ammunition,
cannon and clothing were placed in the ferryboat,
and regiments one at a time were brought down to the
river. The horses with their bridles and halters were
driven into the stream and forced to take their chances,
not only with the rapid current, but with the driftwood,
which was very abundant and large. At some places
it covered almost the entire surface. The stream was
five-eighths of a mile wide. Many of the men clung
to the ferryboat and thus swam across. Some held to
the canoes and floated by their side, while others swam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
with their horses, holding to their manes or tails to
prevent being swept down stream by its fierce tides.
As the first detachment crossed over, the Federal
pickets undertook to resist the landing. The part of
the Confederates who were in the ferryboat and canoe
with their clothes on, rushed into line, while those who
swam, unwilling to be laggard, not halting to dress,
seized their cartridge boxes and guns and rushed upon
the enemy. The strange sight of naked men engaging
in combat for a moment amazed the enemy. They
had never seen soldiers before clad only in nature’s
garb; they concluded that warriors, fully grown and
armed, just born into the world, were the men they
must fight. Amid such scenes as this was begun the
thousand mile march which constituted Morgan’s
Ohio Raid. The animals were quickly corralled and
saddled, lines promptly formed, and the onslaught
upon the Federals begun. It did not take long for
Morgan’s men to discover that their presence was not
only unwelcome, but was expected. In a little while
dead troopers, dead steeds, abandoned clothing, lost
haversacks and wrecked wagons along the highway gave
mute but convincing proof of war’s terrors and war’s
exactions. The Southern raiders thus early learned
that the campaign would not be completed without much
of conflict and loss. It did not take long to drive Woolford’s
Federal cavalry out of Columbia. Nothing
could stay the impetuous rush of these riders towards
the Bluegrass. The resistance was feeble, but it was
enough to show that enemies were abundant and alert.
A few dead and wounded were left by both sides in
Columbia, but these were remitted to the ministrations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
and care of non-combatants, while the fighters rode
forward to new conflicts. The enthusiasm of homecoming
lent renewed courage and ever-increasing
vehemence to the Kentuckians, and they were ready to
ride over anything that obstructed the way that
pointed toward their friends farther up the state.</p>

<p>At Green River Stockade was stationed the 25th
Michigan Infantry, commanded by Colonel O. B.
Moore. The position of the stockade had been selected
with great skill and protected by an impassable line,
consisting of trees and rifle pits and sharpened pieces of
wood with some wires and fencing. Against this a
couple of regiments were hurled, but in vain. When
surrender had been demanded of Colonel Moore, the
Federal commander, he returned the laconic answer
that “the Fourth of July was no day for me to entertain
such a proposition.” He was a brave, gallant and
fearless foe, and his patriotic response won the respect
of his enemies. The tone of his reply foreboded trouble.
The Confederates were not long in finding out that he
was prepared in action to back up his words of eloquent
defiance. General Morgan was compelled in a little
while to do what his judgment now told him he should
have done in the outset, that is to leave the stockade
and the infantry alone. They were really not in his
way, could do him no damage if left unmolested, and
could join in no pursuit when once he had passed them
by. In thirty minutes’ fighting more than forty men
were killed and forty-five wounded. Of the enemy,
nine were killed and twenty-six wounded. Colonel
Chenault of the 11th Kentucky, Major Brent of the
5th, Lieutenant Cowan of the 3d, Lieutenants Holloway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
and Ferguson of the 5th were among the valiant
and gallant officers who laid down their lives on that
day for their country.</p>

<p>In any protracted war, all commands which extensively
participate have their dark days, and in some
respects, outside the disaster at Buffington Island,
fifteen days later, the darkest day that ever came
to General Morgan’s division was this sad 4th of July.
For a little while it checked the enthusiasm and
stilled the quickened heartbeats of the returning exiles.
On the morrow at Lebanon there would be other sorrowful
experiences and the hope of home-going would temporarily
vanish when at Lebanon the head of the column
turned west instead of continuing east.</p>

<p>On that grim day at Green River Stockade the 11th
under Chenault and the 5th under Colonel Smith were
asked to do the impossible. They stood until standing
was no longer wise, or even brave. The Federal commander
reported that the fighting lasted three hours,
but the real fighting lasted less than three-quarters
of an hour, and with something less than six hundred
men engaged, about forty-five were killed and the same
number wounded. This was a distressing percentage
of mortality under the circumstances of the battle.</p>

<p>Chenault, impetuous, gallant, died close up to the
enemy with his face to the foe. Major Brent, of the
5th Kentucky, so full of promise, was killed as he rode
up to salute Colonel James B. McCreary, who succeeded
Chenault in command of the 11th. Captain
Treble, of Christmas raid fame, was among the men
who gave their lives on this field for the Southland.
As he rose to salute the colonel, who had become such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
by the death of Chenault, and waved his hand to let
him know that he would be ready when the order
came, he fell, struck by a bullet that crushed through
his brain.</p>

<p>None of those who saw these dead brought out
under the flag of truce, and the wounded carried in
blankets from out of the woods and from the ravines
and laid along the turnpike road from Columbia to
Lebanon, will ever forget the harrowing scene. When
they looked upon the dead, with their pallid faces
turned heavenward, and their pale hands folded across
their stilled breasts, poignant grief filled every heart.
It did not take long to bury or arrange for burial of
the dead. Humanity would care for the wounded,
and war’s demands bade the remaining soldiers press
forward, and by midnight the division camped a few
miles out from Lebanon to rest for the conflict on the
morrow.</p>

<p>Colonel Charles Hanson, who commanded the 20th
Kentucky Federal Infantry, had prepared to make the
best defense possible at Lebanon. He placed his men
in the brick depot and in the houses surrounding it.
General Morgan disliked to leave anything behind, and
so he resolved to capture this force. It was captured,
but the cost did not justify the losses. It was there
that we saw General Morgan’s youngest brother,
“Tom,” as they familiarly called him, go down in the
storm. He was a first lieutenant in the 2d Kentucky
and was then serving on General Duke’s staff. With
the fiery courage of youth, backed by a fearless heart,
in the excitement of battle he exposed his person and
was struck down by a shot from the depot. War<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
allows no time for partings. It permits no preparation
for the great beyond. Standing close to his brother,
he could only exclaim, “Brother, I am killed. I am
killed,” and then fell into the grief-stricken brother’s
arms. He was a mere lad, but he died like a hero.</p>

<p>The taking of a brick depot with several hundred
men inside, in war, is not an easy job. It was to cost
ten killed and thirty wounded. Here I witnessed what
appeared to be one of the bravest things I have ever
observed. The 8th Kentucky—Cluke’s—with which
I was connected, was ordered to charge the front of the
depot. The men were advancing through a field where
the weeds were waist-high. It was difficult marching.
The thermometer stood over a hundred in the shade,
and the foliage of the weeds made the heat still more
intense. It was this regiment’s fortune to face the larger
door of the depot. It was said that somebody had
blundered, but the charge was ordered and the men
enthusiastically and bravely obeyed. When within
a few hundred feet of the door, the order was passed
along to “lie down.” The time in which the “lying
down” was done seemed many hours. The regiment
was subject to the stinging fire of the Federals in the
depot. A number of the men were hit by shots which
struck the front of the body and ranged downward
through the limbs of the soldiers. Such wounds produced
excruciating tortures.</p>

<p>A man by my side was shot in the shoulder this
way. He was a brave, uneducated, but faithful mountain
soldier. He came from around Somerset and had
been a cattle drover before he went away to war.
Why he had ever volunteered I never could fully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
fathom. He had no property, he had no relatives in
the Confederacy. He had made a few casual acquaintances
in his journeyings as a drover, but these could
hardly have influenced him to risk his life for the
Southland. He was not a man to seek war for the glory
or excitement of campaigning.</p>

<p>Men of his calling are rarely communicative or
confidential. Finally one night, on a lonely scout
through the mountains, he unburdened his soul and
told me why he had gone to war. There was something
in the isolation of our surroundings, the constant presence
of danger, the depressing shadows of the trees
which shut out even the starlight, that made the
heavy-hearted man long for human sympathy, and in
sad, sad tones he told me his life’s tragedy. He was
thirty-two years of age and had fallen desperately in
love with a young girl he had met while driving stock
along the Wilderness Road, having stopped one night
at her father’s house. At the end of each journey he
had purchased souvenirs for his sweetheart, small
mirrors, plain rings, garnet breastpins and plated bracelets
and an occasional dress of many colors, the equal
of Joseph’s coat, and these conveyed in the most delicate
way to the young lady the great love that was
being enkindled in the heart of the silent, undemonstrative
drover. He could speak no words, but in deferential
courtesy, through these simple tokens, he endeavored
to declare the turmoil raging in his bosom.</p>

</figure>

<p>He had never the courage to tell her of his affection.
He had worshipped in this patient style at the shrine
of her beauty and forecast in his mind a happy, happy
time when in a log cabin on the mountain side he should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>claim her for his bride and set up his household gods
in a humble abode. He had in the past loved nobody
else, and he had persuaded himself that in the future
he would never love again, and at the end of each trip
he carried back these homely offerings, showing how,
in his humble way, he worshipped her ruddy face, her
bright eyes and wavy hair, and dreamed as only lovers
can dream of the exquisite joy and happiness that would
overshadow his life if he might but make her his own.</p>

<p>Upon returning from one of his long drives, he
found that she had married another. He uttered no
word of complaint, he gave expression to no outcry
of grief. He realized that his case was hopeless, that
the brightest dream of his life had been shattered, that
he had lost his first and only love. He nursed in the
depths of his soul the disappointment and sorrow that
overwhelmed his joyous anticipations of a blissful
future. He could not bear to pass her home any more.
He had naught of this world’s goods but a few dollars
in coin, a saddle, bridle and an old bob-tailed black
horse which had become his when style and symmetry
had put him below the more exacting standards of the
Bluegrass, and condemned him to spend the last years
of his horse life amongst the less fastidious fanciers
of the mountains. He called his steed “Bob-Tail.”
He had been nicked in his youth, and now that age had
dignified his demeanor and slowed his speed, he made a
hardy and reliable mount for his steady-going owner,
who loved him for his kindly disposition and for his
cheerful performance of every duty, however severe.
They seemed to have a common sympathy and fellowship
in that both had lost out in the struggle of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span></p>

<p>He gave up driving, and one day when Morgan rode
through Somerset, he mounted his old black steed,
waved a kindly adieu to his few acquaintances, and rode
away to war, little caring whether he lived or died.</p>

<p>He was always cheerful, brave, patient and well up
at the front. He insisted upon doing for me all possible
services, caring for my horse, keeping my saddle,
bridle and arms in good shape. There was no sacrifice
he would not have made for me, and he had won my
heart. He clung to me because I knew his heart’s
tragedy and because he must love somebody now that
his life was a ruin and blank.</p>

<p>The Enfield ball passed almost through his entire
body and the suffering was so horrible that his groans
were agonizing. He begged somebody to bear him off
the field. The order had been issued to shoot any man
who arose. This was done to prevent the Federals from
getting the exact range of the regiment which was now
lying down with their heads toward the depot. While
in this position, I observed what was to me the bravest
thing I had ever seen in the war. I always thought it
was the 5th Kentucky, but General Duke says it was
the 2d. The men from this regiment charged on the
south side of the depot with their pistols and guns and
marched up to the windows and put their weapons in
through the openings and fired into the mass of Federals
inside. It required almost superhuman courage
to undertake this act, yet it was done with a calmness
that would thrill every observer, and those of us who
were lying on the ground and watching this splendid
move and realized what it meant for our relief, cheered
and cheered the courage of these valiant warriors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
The groans of my wounded friend became so distressing
and harassing that finally I received permission to rise
and take him on my back and bear him from the field,
where the bullets were still whizzing. Wounded and
suffering as he was, I had only time to commend him
to the surgeons and bid him good-bye. He took my
hand and pressed it to his now bloodless lips, and his
great black eyes filled with tears when he looked up
at me and said that he would see my face no more.
After my return to Louisville in 1868, succeeding a
three years’ exile, I observed in Cave Hill Cemetery
the grave of my wounded friend, Vincent Eastham.
The stone which comrades had erected to his memory
was marked “5th Kentucky Cavalry,” but I pointed
out the mistake and put the proper endorsement on
his marker, “Company B, 8th Kentucky Cavalry.”
Each Decoration Day, with those near to me, we carry
armfuls of flowers to make beautiful the mound where
he sleeps, and my children and my children’s children
have been asked to keep green the spot where my
mountain friend so calmly rests amongst his Confederate
comrades in Louisville’s beautiful “City of the
Dead.”</p>

<p>The next ten days were full of intensest excitement
and harassing marching. This marching was done
in the midst of stifling dust, intense heat and almost
constant battle. On the 8th day of July the command
crossed the Ohio River at Brandenburg, capturing a
couple of steamboats and fighting off gunboats, until
at last, on the evening of that day, General Morgan
and his division camped on northern soil.</p>

<p>No courtesies were expected, and certainly none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
were received from the people of the “Hoosier State.”
They harassed and distressed Morgan’s march all they
could. If they worried Morgan, he was more than even
with them. Absurd stories of the Confederate and his
followers had gone on before the line of his march, and
fear and dismay filled all hearts when they saw the
dust clouds or heard the shots that proclaimed his
presence. These reports with each telling became more
gruesome and horrible and when they stole from behind
trees, or out of the thickets, for a sight of his riders,
they refused to believe that these men in gray were not
real, sure enough devils, horns, hoofs and all. Even
rhyme was put under conscription to help tell how awful
they were, and words like these were carried by speedy
couriers in their dashes along the roads to prepare the
country folk for the dreadful catastrophe that was
breaking upon the innocent people of Southern
Indiana:</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“I’m sent to warn the neighbors, he’s only a mile behind.</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Each day was full of strenuous work, night marching,
incessant fighting, guerrilla firing, obstructions of
roads, and on the night of the 12th of July, General
Morgan and his men were sixty miles north of the
Ohio River and far up into the State of Indiana. The
average march for all these days was forty miles,
counting detours, under difficulties that sorely taxed
human powers.</p>

<p>On the 12th of July the command made thirty-eight
miles, although this was the eleventh day in the saddle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span></p>

<p>Scattered along the fence corners for four miles,
at a little town called Milam on the line of the Ohio &amp;
Michigan Railroad, Morgan and his command caught
a few hours’ rest. Some subtle and mysterious instinct
came to them that the morrow would demand heroic
work. They seemed to breathe in the very air that
something great was expected of them. The beasts
laid down in slumber and rest beside the tired bodies
of their persistent riders. Voices of unseen bodies
seemed to whisper to them that on the morrow they
would attempt the longest continued cavalry march
ever said to have been made by twenty-five hundred
men in column. Stuart, when he started from Chambersburg,
was rested. For twelve hours he had slept.
Forrest, when in pursuit of Streight, had briefly
halted at Courtland, Alabama, but these Morgan’s
men had been marching and fighting for ten days and
yet fate was to put up to them the task of excelling
human records. Two and a half miles away were
twenty-five hundred Federal troops. Although humanity
would suggest that the saddles should be stripped
from the backs of the tired horses, the calls of the hour
were such that mercy could make no response and every
man slept with his bridle rein over his arm, and in his
weary hand he held his trusted gun.</p>

<p>They were now over four hundred miles from the
place where they began their march, in territory held
by the enemy. They were beset on every side with
forces sent for their capture. Guides were unfaithful,
and sometimes the main roads were blockaded and
ambuscades frequent. The column was three miles
long and already there was a number of sick and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
wounded in buggies and wagons. Under all these
conditions, men might well ask, “Can this great task
be accomplished?”</p>

<p>Morgan felt that the men riding with him were
thoroughbreds. They were the grandsons of the pioneers
given by Virginia, Maryland, Carolina, in the
savage work of wresting Kentucky from the Indians,
and the pioneers had given Kentucky men a name and
fame wherever the English tongue had been spoken.
They were sons, or grandsons, of the men who had
fought the Battles of Blue Lick, Maumee, Fort Stevenson,
the Thames, of the Raisin, Tippecanoe, New
Orleans, Cerro Gordo, Buena Vista, and their great
leader, with the knowledge of what they had done
and faith in what they could accomplish, already in
his own mind was asking, “Can this thing be done?”</p>

<p>These troopers had never failed him either in the
march or on the field. If it were possible for men to
do it, he knew it would be done. He knew that they
would try, and if they failed it would be only because
the accomplishment of such a task was humanly impossible.</p>

<p>The command to mount was his answer to these
curious questionings which forced themselves into his
brain, as in the dim light of the early dawn he looked
over their sleeping forms and found it hard in his heart
to rouse them from their death-like slumber.</p>

<p>Out into the dusty roads before the rays of the
scorching July sun should be felt, he bade them wake
and ride.</p>

<p>By twelve o’clock thirty-two miles were done.
Across the White River into Harrison, Ohio, they rode.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
The torch was applied to the great bridge that crossed
White River and as the blazes lifted hissing tongues
high in the air, and while they watched the timbers
crumble under the conquering hand of fire, the advance
guard of the Federals exchanged shots over the stream
with the rear guard of the Confederates.</p>

<p>The men could manage a few hours without food.
They had fared well along the line in the plenteous and
forsaken kitchens and dining rooms of the frightened
inhabitants, who, upon the advance of the Confederates,
left their tables loaded with well-prepared food
and fled into the woods and fields to escape the terrors
of what they called Morgan’s “murderers and horse
thieves.”</p>

<p>The well-filled cribs and stables of the people of
Harrison supplied the tired horses with a good feed.
This was the last stop they were to make until they
should end the march, and so the General allowed a
brief rest and time to satisfy appetites, quickened by
the long and tedious ride of the morning.</p>

<p>An hour was consumed in marching and counter-marching
so as to mislead General Burnside and his
thirty thousand soldiers at Cincinnati, only thirty-two
miles away. These men at Cincinnati were planning
to create a wall of infantry which it would be impossible
for Morgan to pass.</p>

<p>Haste, haste, haste, was the watchword of the hour,
and down the valley toward the Big Miami River the
Confederate column moved. At dusk the long, wooden
bridge across the Big Miami was struck. Bridges and
railroads were dangerous enemies to leave in the rear,
and the torch was called into requisition. As the red<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
flames, created by the great burning timbers, rose
skyward, they illumined the entire valley; and in the
flickering shadows which they cast for several miles
around, in the gloaming of the evening, among the trees
and fences and buildings, huge, weird forms, born, it
is true, of the imagination, filled the minds and hearts
of the invading horsemen for the moment with apprehensive
awe and depressing forebodings.</p>

<p>At midnight fifty-five miles had been marched by
the ceaseless tramp of the wearied steeds. A hundred
and forty-four thousand steps they had already taken,
and still more than a hundred thousand were to be
required before they could rest their tired limbs, and
well might they inquire as their riders still spurred
them onward, “Masters, masters, be ye men or devils
which exact from your beasts such unseemly toil and
fearful sufferings?” With the darkness of the night
the fears seemed to subside, if fears there were. The
wearied bodies called for sleep, sleep, yet there could
be no staying for “tired nature’s sweet restorer.”
The early hours of the night were filled with suffering,
but as the intense darkness which preceded the coming
dawn enveloped the column, the strain became still
more terrible. Horses, unwilling and unable to go
further forward, sank down in death with their riders
astride still urging them onward, and under the dreadful
physical burdens, strong men fell from their beasts
as if smitten with sudden death. Hundreds of the men
lashed themselves to their saddles while fighting the
assaults of sleep. Riders losing consciousness failed
to close up, and by the time the rear of the columns
was reached, this closing up kept a large portion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
column much of the time in a gallop. Once it became
necessary with lighted candles to crawl upon hands and
knees and by the tracks determine which road the vanguard
had ridden. Comrades, dismounted by the breaking
down of their weakened steeds, walked beside the
line, keeping pace with the horses, while others, where
possible, sprang up behind their companions until a
convenient stable by the roadside would provide a new
mount.</p>

<p>A common sense of danger told even the most
careless rider that the passage around Cincinnati was
the moment of extreme danger, and as the column came
nearer and nearer to that line, the thought that the
supreme moment was at hand gave renewed strength
and wakefulness to the majority of the men now attempting
an unprecedented march.</p>

<p>Three times during the night General Morgan
changed guides, and each time it was necessary by
either open or covert threat to force an enemy to lead
the column. Guides were informed that the compass
would tell the story of their treachery and that death
would be the sure consequence of their bad faith.</p>

<p>There was no direct line along which the command
could march, and the change of direction did much to
confuse the column. The crawl of the artillery and a
large number of buggies bearing sick and wounded
comrades over a hilly and woody country amidst
almost absolute darkness, with here and there an unfriendly
shot, made an ordeal which rarely if at all had
come into soldier life.</p>

<p>By two o’clock in the morning the dead line at
Glendale was passed. The Federal commander, deceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
by Morgan’s marching and counter-marching,
had carried a large body of troops too far north and Morgan
had slipped through at this neglected point, and
his strategy had foiled the Federal commander’s
chances and efforts to check the invader. This line
was crossed at a high rate of speed. If the passage of
the troops had been obstructed, there was nothing to
do but to ride over those who attempted to stay the
march, and so every man rose in his stirrups, grasped
his bridle reins with firmer hold, unswung his gun from
his shoulder and carried it on the pommel of his saddle,
and felt to be sure that his trusted revolvers were in
their appointed places in his belt at his side. If foe
appeared, woe be unto that foe unless he could present
himself in such vast numbers as to stay the charge of
twenty-five hundred troopers upon whose courage at
this moment depended the escape of the division.
The calls of the hour were met with a cheerful response.
Every man carried in his bosom a firm resolve to sweep
any foe from the appointed path and to cut his way
through any ranks that might oppose his going. The
intense emergencies of the moment made them almost
hope that somebody would get in their way. There
came into their minds a desire to fight rather than ride
through, and a touch of pride made them anxious for
some sort of contest to show that after all the wear and
tear of the past twelve days they were quite as brave
and virile as when in the flush of the beginning they had
forced a passage of the Cumberland River. Fear
seemed to vanish and prudence fled away, as these
night riders saw the people of Glendale rush out into
the streets, or from raised windows, with dreading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
apprehension, watch the strange procession gallop
through the streets. In the enthusiasm of the moment,
the dust-stained Confederates cheered for Jefferson
Davis and the Southern Confederacy and bade the
alarmed onlookers tell General Burnside and his bluecoats
that Morgan and his men had come and gone.
Mind rose superior to the pain and weariness of body,
and in these words of good-natured badinage was a new
evidence of the valor and spirit of these bold raiders.</p>

<p>Though the line was passed, safety was not yet
assured. The larger bodies of infantry were close at
hand. A great task had been accomplished, and still
there were thirty-eight miles ahead, and this distance,
now every moment growing longer and longer, the weary
horsemen knew must be covered before solid rest was
attainable. In a little while the sunshine came to
brighten the earth and to cheer as it always does cheer
struggling humanity, but the record was yet unbroken.
Every mile seemed to grow into a dozen miles. Each
step brought increasing suffering. Skirmishes and contact
with the militia would arouse the men for a brief
while, but with the cessation of the excitement, nature
would again lift its cry for mercy and plead for sleep
for man and beast.</p>

<p>And so on and on and on until the sun was about
to hide its face behind the western slopes, and at four
o’clock in the afternoon, on the 14th, the column, now
struggling and oppressed with both hunger and weariness,
reached Williamsburg, Ohio, and camped for the
night, and the greatest single cavalry march of the
world, composed of as large a force as twenty-five
hundred men, was ended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span></p>

<p>Ninety-five and a quarter miles in thirty-two hours
of marching! Surely such work was not unworthy of
what the Confederacy asked of its sons.</p>

<p>As these hard riders dismounted they stood for a
moment helpless with fatigue. Leaning against a horse
or a fence they would sleep standing, and in taking
food to recuperate their wearied bodies, would sink
into slumber. It was a great triumph for Confederate
cavalry, and amid all its terrors and horrors it was worth
something to realize that the record of human endurance
had been lifted several degrees higher. The future had
yet in store for some of these men much of hardship
and much of renown—imprisonment in the Ohio
penitentiary, at Camp Chase, Camp Douglass, Johnson’s
Island, Fort Delaware, for many, death under the
chafings, starvation and cruelties of Northern prisons;
but out of these there would come a remnant who
should, when others had capitulated, ride as an escort
for Jefferson Davis when Richmond and Columbia would
be in ruins and all hope for the nation’s life had fled.</p>

<p>There would yet come a time when to these still
hoping men, hope would fail, when the Confederate
Armies would be shattered and scattered, when Lee
had surrendered and Johnson capitulated, when the
western army and the Army of Northern Virginia, its
veterans paroled, would turn their tear-stained faces
toward their desolated homes and take up anew the
burdens of life; when all the mighty legions west of
the Mississippi, which had maintained for four years
the mightiest conflict of the ages, would stack their
guns, sheath their swords, and accept war’s decrees
for surrender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span></p>

<p>They were yet to see a time when the President of
the Confederacy should go forth from the seat of government,
and in sadness and gloom ride away from the
Confederate capital to seek refuge south of Virginia.
There were some of these men who were here at this
hour destined and appointed still to cling to Jefferson
Davis’ fortunes and defend his person in the period of
surpassing disaster and sadness, when with a broken
heart he would realize that his nation was dead and he
was without a country. There would come a time when
a pitying Providence should provide out of these
soldiers for the first and only Confederate President a
depleted bodyguard, who would go with him in his
reverses and humiliation, and who were to stand guard
over him and his cabinet, to beat off pursuing foes at a
time when every man’s hand would be against him and
them, when fate would hide its face and give him over
to a cruel, brutal mocking and an imprisonment which
would shock the world’s sense of mercy and justice.
There were men now closing this great ride who would
be present when the wretchedness of death would hover
over and around the Southern cause, and would look
upon the last council of war. When the greatness of the
South should end in desolation and ruin, some of these
riders were, in the closing hours of the Confederacy,
to offer anew their lives and their all to the cause
which they loved to the end, and for which they had
sacrificed their fortunes; and yet in the blackness of
death and the final agonies of their nation would again
cheerfully tender their all, to prolong even for an hour
its hopes and its existence. They were yet by their
exalted courage to glorify that cause for which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
South had endured untold and immeasurable suffering,
and would by a crowning act of constancy take a
deserved place on the brightest pages of human annals
that record patriotic fortitude and valor.</p>

<p>A few hundred of these men now closing this wonderful
march would accompany Jefferson Davis in his
last effort to avoid capture, and would only leave him
and those he loved, when he should plead that their
presence would only endanger his escape. They would
only depart when he commanded them to go, and urged
them by their loyalty and devotion to him to listen to
his appeal—that they leave him alone in the supreme
hour of his political grief and distress.</p>

<p>Some of these men would also be present when the
last sun that ever shone on the Confederate States, as a
nation, was lengthening its rays on its western course,
and sending forth a fading glow on the sad scenes of
national dissolution which would, if it were possible,
with nature’s shadings, make glorious and immortal
the faces of the heroes who, in anguish and awe, looked
upon its death throes, a nation that in its brief days
of four eventful years was to make a history that would
win the admiration and love of all the people of succeeding
ages, who read the story of their suffering, their
valor, their loyalty and their devotion to principle
and country.</p>

<p>Some of these riders were to be faithful unto death,
and have a full share of that glorious crown of immortality
which fate would hereafter decree to the men of
the South as a compensation for a victory, which,
though deserved, should be denied.</p>

RICHARDS WITH MOSBY’S MEN IN THE<br>

FEBRUARY 19, 1864</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">In all military history, Colonel John S. Mosby and
his command had neither a counterpart nor a
parallel. Man for man, Mosby and his men did
more, proportionately, to damage, to harass, to delay
and to disturb the Federal forces than any equal
number of soldiers who wore the gray.</p>

<p>John Singleton Mosby was born in Powhatan
County, Virginia, in December, 1833, fifty miles south
of the scenes of his wonderful military exploits. He
came from refined, cultured and well-to-do people, and
as was the custom in those days amongst the better
class in that State, he was educated at the University
of Virginia. His courage early developed itself. Some
trouble with a fellow-student suspended his career in
the University. He prepared himself for the practice
of law, and when the war broke out, he was engaged in
his profession at Bristol. He was among the very first
men to offer for the Confederate service for twelve
months. War, especially partisan war, had peculiar
fascinations for this young lawyer. He had read and re-read
the history of Sumter and Marion, and he longed
for opportunity and occasion to engage in similar work.
He knew every detail of the things they had done in
the struggle of the colonies for liberty. While his eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span>
scanned the lines of Blackstone and Story, dreams of
military glory flitted before his vision. The excitement,
din, rush and fury of war appealed to his nature and
he sighed for a chance to see and know what real war
was. He shirked no duty, sought every possible opportunity
for inflicting loss upon his country’s enemies.
Enlisted for twelve months, he refused the furlough
accorded men who served that length of time, and he re-enlisted
for the war. His enterprise and his daring won
him promotion, and by February, 1862, he was the
adjutant of his regiment. He resigned because of some
misunderstanding between Colonel William E. Jones
and General Stuart, but the latter was quick to note
men of Mosby’s ability and military aptitude and he
put him on his staff as a scout and adviser. He held
this position and rode with Stuart on his Chickahominy
raid in June, 1862. He was almost the same age as
his commander. He was quieter, but none the less
brave. He took service more seriously than General
Stuart; war with him was a passion, not a pastime.
He loved war for the excitement and experience it
brought, for the opportunities it offered to his genius
for development, and devoid of fear, he was glad when
chance brought his way the legal right to fight.</p>

<p>It was only a brief period until his marvelous efficiency
and his masterful sagacity, as well as his extraordinary
courage, caused General Stuart to give him a
small independent command. He used this so effectively
that his forces were quickly increased and the
area of his operations enlarged. He had men in his
battalion from almost all parts of the world, but the
majority was composed of young soldiers who came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
from Virginia and Maryland. There was so much that
was fascinating and attractive in the service in which
Mosby was engaged that there was no difficulty in
finding recruits who were the impersonation, not
only of valor, but of dash. He enjoyed in the highest
degree the confidence not only of General Stuart, but
of General Lee, and the only criticism which General
Lee ever passed on Mosby was his ability to catch
bullets and win wounds.</p>

<p>In 1863 he engaged in a successful exploit, which
largely added to his fame. With twenty-nine men,
he penetrated the Federal lines and captured General
Stoughton in his headquarters in the midst of his
division, at Fairfax Court House, Virginia. This
secured promotion for Mosby. Nothing in the war
was more skillfully or recklessly done than this capture
of General Stoughton. There are no mathematic
quantities by which the damage that Mosby inflicted
upon the Federals can be calculated. For every one
man under his command, he kept one hundred Federals
from the front. Had Colonel Mosby enjoyed the
opportunities of other Confederate cavalry leaders,
he would have won a fame and rank equal to either
Forrest or Wheeler or Morgan or Stuart or Hampton.
Had he gone to West Point and entered the war with
the experience and prestige which came to men who
had enjoyed military education, there would have been
few officers in the Confederate Army who would have
surpassed him in military achievement. At the period
when Mosby first began his partisan career, there was
no other man in the armies of the South who, with the
means at hand, could have inflicted such damage on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
the enemy, or have accomplished such great results
for his country.</p>

<p>A number of books have been written about Mosby
and his men, and yet they can only touch a few of the
wonderful things done by this wonderful man with his
wonderful followers. He had no equipment of any
kind. His men knew nothing about tents, and they
had substantially no commissary and no quartermaster.
They lived largely off their enemies and
when not pursuing these, passed the time with their
friends.</p>

<p>Mosby operated in four Virginia counties. This
country became known as “Mosby’s Confederacy,”
and the “Debatable Land.” However often the Federals
invaded it they never could feel that their title
was secure. This “Debatable Land” was not more
than sixty miles long by forty miles wide, and yet in
this limited area Mosby and his men subsisted, fought
and disquieted the Federal army, in a way that demoralized
its trains and kept its soldiers in a state of
constant dread and apprehension. While the organization
consisted of several companies, never at any one
time did Colonel Mosby have more than four hundred
men, and most of the time far less. These four hundred
men, or whatever their number may have been, destroyed
more Federal property than any other equal
number of men in the Confederacy; and it is truly said
of them that they gave the Federal troops more trouble
than any five thousand men of any other command.
Most of their work was in the rear of their foes. In a
fight, General Forrest said one man in the rear was
equal to three in the front, but in Mosby’s operations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
one man behind the Federal lines counted more than
twenty in front.</p>

<p>Mosby was cool, calm, fearless, dauntless. He
inspired his men with his own confidence, faith and
hope. They all respected him—most of them feared
him—and all were glad to follow him. There was
something in his personality that created in the minds
of his followers absolute trust. They believed in him
and they knew that he could be relied upon in all
emergencies and that whether in the storm of battle,
in the haste of retreat, or in the rush of the charge,
Mosby was always at himself, and he was sure to do
the wisest and the most sagacious thing under any
contingency that might arise.</p>

<p>In Mosby’s command there was no room for cowardice
and no place for cowards. The men who went
with him took their lives in their hands. They knew
that following him meant constant danger, ceaseless
activity, incessant watchfulness and reckless service,
and they were willing in exchange for the glory which
they might gain, to assume all the risks that were incident
to the daily life of the adherents of this silent,
bold and fearless man.</p>

<p>Mosby’s operations were largely confined to Fauquier
and Loudoun County, Virginia. Occasionally
he crossed the line into Prince William County, and
sometimes operated in Culpepper, but Fauquier County
was the chief scene of his operations. In the later
months of the war he was practically always within
the enemy’s lines. He never had a camp, except for a
small number of his men, and then only for a brief
while. There was no place for Mosby to hide himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
except among those who loved the Cause in these
counties. In cabins and barns and in the forest and
among the hills, his command found their home.
Rarely more than two or three of them ever remained
together. They scattered, as has been said, like the
mist when the sun rose. When the Federals undertook
to pursue them, the pursuit became like the chase after
a phantom. If followed, they dispersed through the
country into the crossroads and by-ways and among
their friends and sympathizers. The exploits of Marion
and Sumter become as a fading light when compared
with the glamour and splendor of the work of Mosby
and his men for the Confederacy. When they met, it
was by preconcerted arrangement, or in answer to the
calls of couriers. Much of their work was done at night.
For the three years in which Mosby was engaged in
active operations, there was rarely a single day that
some of his men were not operating somewhere on the
enemy’s line and on the enemy’s forces. In the activity
of his campaigning the death rate was high, but
there was always an abundance of daring spirits that
were ready to take the places of those who had fallen
in this desperate game of war.</p>

<p>Mosby taught his men to eschew sabres, to use no
guns, but to rely upon the pistol alone. This meant
fighting at close range, hand to hand combat. He and
his men seemed to be everywhere; they were ever the
terror and dread of the Federal Army. The men who
guarded the wagon trains heard always with tremor
the name of Mosby. With the exception of General
Forrest, Colonel Mosby was the most feared and hated
of all Confederate leaders. The writer of a history of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
his command says: “He kept in a defensive attitude,
according to their own admission, thirty-five thousand
of their troops which would otherwise have been employed
in the active theatre of war. But this was not
all. More than once, with his band, he compelled the
invading army to relinquish actual and projected lines
of communication, to fall back from advance positions,
and, if we may credit the assertion of the Federal
Secretary of War, occasioned a loss of an important
battle.”</p>

<p>The things done by Mosby and his men were so
out of the ordinary that they simply challenge belief
and surpass comprehension. In the capture of General
Stoughton, two of his staff officers and thirty other
prisoners, in the midst of the Federal division, and removing
them and their equipment and fifty-eight horses
into Confederate lines without the loss of a man,
appears impossible.</p>

<p>With a small body of men, he passed the rear of
Sheridan’s army in the valley of Virginia, and after a
brisk skirmish, captured and brought away General
Duffie of the Federal Army. With less than one hundred
men he made a forced march into the enemy’s
lines at night, captured many prisoners, derailed a
train, destroyed it, and secured as his prey two paymasters,
who had in their possession one hundred
and sixty-eight thousand dollars in United States
currency. Refusing to take anything himself, he divided
this money amongst his followers and each one with
him on this expedition received twenty-one hundred
dollars.</p>

<p>With three hundred men he rode to the rear of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
Sheridan’s army in the valley of Virginia and attacked
in broad daylight a brigade of infantry and two hundred
and fifty cavalrymen, guarding a wagon train. He
burned one hundred wagons, captured two hundred
and eight prisoners and brought away five hundred
mules and horses and two hundred head of cattle.</p>

<p>When all these amazing things have been told they
would make any one man great, but Mosby had to his
credit dozens of other feats almost equally as remarkable.</p>

<p>Colonel Mosby was wounded several times, and in
December, 1864, he was desperately injured and was
compelled to take a long furlough.</p>

<p>In 1863 there came to Colonel Mosby’s command a
young Virginian, A. E. Richards. Beginning as a
private, by his soldierly qualities he rose to be major.
Christened Adolphus Edward Richards, he became
known among Mosby’s followers as “Dolly.” When
he succeeded Mosby he was just twenty years of age,
and no man in the Confederacy, twenty years old,
accomplished more or exhibited a nobler courage or
more remarkable skill and enterprise.</p>

<p>From December, 1864, until April, 1865, was one
of the most strenuous periods of Mosby’s command.
The Federal Army was then engaged around Richmond,
and this left a hundred miles’ space for the operation
of these aggressive cavaliers. For months, while
Mosby was off, wounded, Major Richards not only
took up but efficiently carried on his work. Two of
the fights in which he commanded were used by Colonel
George Taylor Denison, of Canada, in his work on
“Modern Cavalry,” published in 1868, to illustrate
the superiority of the revolver as a weapon for cavalry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span></p>

<p>Just at this time, Colonel Harry Gilmor, who enjoyed
a wide reputation as a partisan leader in Northern
Virginia and Maryland, had been surprised and made
prisoner. The Federals, encouraged by this success,
undertook to capture Major Richards and scatter
Mosby’s men.</p>

<p>General Merritt, then in charge of the Federal
cavalry operating in “Mosby’s Confederacy,” sent the
same detail which had caught Gilmor to hunt down
Richards and his followers. The party comprising
this force numbered two hundred and fifty men and was
in charge of Major Thomas Gibson of the 14th Pennsylvania
Cavalry. This officer, in the past, had shown
that he was not only brave but resourceful, and his
superiors hoped as well as expected that he would do
great things on this expedition. If he could catch
Major Richards and a part of his command, it meant
peace in the Federal rear, and the release of many
thousands of men for action at the front. Promotion
was sure to follow success, and the Federal leader
dreamed of becoming a brigadier and winning a renown
that would make him famous.</p>

<p>Attracted by the adventurous nature of the expedition
and also lured by the hope of success in the work,
two of Merritt’s staff officers, Captain Martindale
and Lieutenant Baker, volunteered to aid in this scout.
This command crossed the Shenandoah River at night.
A few miles away from the river, at Paris, in Fauquier
County, the force was divided. Major Gibson took
with him the men of his own regiment, which comprised
one-half of the command, and placed the other half,
from the 1st New York Cavalry, in charge of Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span>
Snow. These forces separated with the understanding
that they would make wide circuits through the
country, would gather prisoners and seize horses, and
meet at Upperville at daylight, six miles from Paris.
A couple of deserters from the 12th Virginia regiment
acted as guides for the two detachments. Through
the report of a spy, Captain Snow learned that Major
Richards had come that night to his father’s house,
near Upperville, and the captain felt it would be a great
feather in his cap if he could make the leader of Mosby’s
command a prisoner. This was what Major Gibson
had been chiefly sent to do, and the Federal captain
calculated if he could do this, he would win the applause
and gratitude of his countrymen. They reached
“Green Garden,” the Richards’ ancestral home, at
one o’clock in the morning. Without warning or signal
of any kind the Federal soldiers surrounded the house
and the leader knocked for admittance at the front
door. Hearing was very acute in those days where
Mosby’s men slept, and the knock, although at first
not very heavy, awoke Major Richards, Captain
Walker and Private Hipkins, who were together
spending the night under the hospitable roof. The
moon was shining with brilliance; not a cloud obscured
its brightness. The ground was covered with snow.
When the Confederates looked through the blinds, they
saw the yard filled with Federal soldiers. On other
occasions, when the odds were not so great, Major
Richards and some of his companions had shot their
way out, but he dared not try this experiment this
time, for it meant almost certain death. To meet such
emergencies, the Richards family had provided a trap
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span>door in the floor of the family room. Major Richards
had only time to seize his pistols and his field glasses,
and his companions hastily caught up their arms, and all
went scurrying down through the trap door into the
space under the sills. This trap door was in the lower
floor and covered with an oil carpet, over which a bed
was rolled. The Federals remained silent for a few moments,
knocked again with more fury, and upon forcing
themselves into the house, the men in blue found Major
Richards’ uniform, his boots with the spurs attached,
his white hat with its black ostrich plume, and they
chuckled and said to themselves, “We have caught him
at last.” Forcing the father of Major Richards to furnish
them candles they searched the house over and over
again. They went from cellar to garret and from garret
to cellar. One officer suggested that in order to make
sure of their game they burn the house, but another,
with nobler instincts and better impulses, protested
so vigorously that this plan was abandoned. For two
hours they scrutinized every portion of the house, the
outbuildings, the stables, the cabins, but all in vain, and
they finally concluded that by some strange sport of
chance their victims had escaped; and they mounted
their horses and rode away to Upperville.</p>

<p>The hours of this search were moments of sore trial
to the three Confederates under the floor. A sneeze, a
cough, would betray their hiding place. Discovery
meant prison—maybe death—and certainly retirement
from the work in which they delighted and which gave
them the consciousness of service to the country to
which they had offered their fortunes and their lives.
Minutes lengthened into days. The tread of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
searching Federals echoed ominously into the silence
and darkness of their place of refuge. Their hearts
beat strong and fast—so furiously that they feared they
might reveal their presence to their enemies. Huddled
close together, with a trusty pistol in each hand, they
waited for what fate might bring. They reviewed over
and over again in their minds what they should do, if
found. Should they open fire and sell their lives as
dearly as possible, or by sudden rush seek to run the
gauntlet of their foes, and thus bring ruin and the torch
upon their family and friends, or accept a long and
baneful imprisonment. In the gloom and dread of their
prison, they could hear every word that was spoken. The
curses and threats to the father and mother cut deep
into their hearts, and they longed for a chance to resent
the insults that were heaped upon the inmates of the
home. Only an inch of wood separated them from their
pursuers, and thus through two long hours they listened,
watched—even prayed—that they might not be
found. The torture of body and mind became almost
unbearable, and they questioned if they should not
rise up, push the trap door ajar, open fire, and rush
away in the din and confusion such an attack was sure
to bring. Each moment that passed they realized
added new chances for escape, and though moments
seemed years, with hearts for every lot, they bided the
end.</p>

<p>Captain Snow and his men rode to the place of
rendezvous. There, fortunately or unfortunately, the
Federals found a barrel of apple brandy. It was a
bitter cold night, and after taking a little brandy they
all took some more and a large number of the men became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
intoxicated. Captain Snow decided that the
best thing for him to do was to hurry back through
Paris and cross the Shenandoah, lest when the sun rose,
Mosby’s men might turn out in large numbers and
destroy him, with his force weakened by their potations.</p>

<p>Suspecting a ruse, the Richards family looked well
in every direction to see that all the Federals had gone,
and that none were lurking in the shadows of the farm
structures. They waited, and then waited some more,
to be sure that there was no mistake about their departure,
and then the bed was rolled back, the trap
door raised, and Major Richards and his two companions,
called by those above, hastily emerged from their
hiding place. Though their uniforms were carried
away by their enemies as a trophy, they felt that they
were not without some compensation. Their horses,
which had been turned loose in a distant pasture, had
neither been seen or captured.</p>

<p>They greeted their steeds with affectionate pats
on their noses and sincerely congratulated themselves
that these had been spared them in the very close call
which had passed their way. The Confederate commander
immediately sent Captain Walker and Private
Hipkins in different directions with urgent orders to
all the men to follow in the track of the enemy. This
they could easily do by the moonlight. All three
rode at highest speed in different directions to tell the
news. The steeds were not spared. Haste was the
watchword of the call to comrades once found. Each
was urged to spread the news in the plain and on the
mountain sides, and to let nothing stay them in the
ride for vengeance and retribution. The Federals had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
left a well-marked trail, and this made pursuit sure and
rapid. Those following were told that it was the plan
to strike the enemy before they could recross the Shenandoah,
and that they must ride fiercely, halt not, and
be prepared for onslaught, pursuit and battle.</p>

<p>Captain Snow rode hard and fast, and he got across
the river before the sun was up. Major Gibson was
not so fortunate. With one hundred and thirty-six
men, when the Confederates under the urgent call of
the couriers that were sent in every direction began
to get together, Gibson was still on the turnpike leading
through Ashby’s Gap across the Blue Ridge Mountains.
They had not gotten down to the foot of the mountains
and were just ahead of Major Richards and the men
that he and his companions had so quickly summoned.
There was no time to count or figure the odds. This
incursion must be resented and few or many, Richards
resolved to attack wherever he found the foe. He had
fought as great odds before, and the extraordinary experience
of the night had quickened his taste for battle
and blood. When he came in touch with the Federals,
he had only twenty-eight men. Five to one had no
terrors for these galloping cavaliers, and Major Richards
determined to make an attack, be the consequences
what they would. In the meantime, ten others came
up, and now he had one to four.</p>

<p>The turnpike at Ashby’s Gap winds its way up the
mountain side by a succession of short curves. Major
Richards arranged his men to press an attack on the
enemy while they were passing around these curves, so
that his real strength would be concealed. The Federal
officer, uncertain what might happen in this country,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
but sure that dangers were lurking in every quarter,
had increased his rear guard to forty men, under the
command of Captain Duff of the 14th Pennsylvania.
A sight of the bluecoats aroused every Mosby man to
impetuous and furious action. They longed to resent
some rough handling that had been given their comrades
a few days before and they bitterly remembered
with indignation the treatment accorded their associates,
and above all they desired to serve notice on
their invaders that it was a risky business to hunt
Mosby’s men in their chosen haunts. The Confederates
rode down in a furious, headlong charge around the
bend of the road and received a volley from the Federal
rear guard. This did no damage, but the Federals
broke into a gallop; with disordered ranks and shattered
files they all scrambled away for safety, and undertook
to reach the main force. The Confederates,
spurring and whooping and yelling, dashed in among
these retreating Federals and used their six shooters
with tremendous effect. The Federals could not fire
their longer guns. There was no chance to turn, and
the rear files felt the pitiless onslaught of the Confederate
column, which was riding so furiously and bent
on destroying their fleeing foes. The shooting was
almost altogether on the side of the Confederates.</p>

<p>At the top of the mountains was Mt. Carmel Church.
Here the Baptists of the neighborhood hitherto were
accustomed to come and worship long before the war.
Its peaceful surroundings and its memories of God’s
service were not in harmony with the rude and savage
war scenes enacted about it on this wintry morn. The
men who rode at that hour with Richards were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
thinking of the dead, who in the quiet and peace of the
country churchyard were waiting Heaven’s call for the
resurrection. They were now dealing only with the
living, and those living who had invaded their country,
ravaged their homes, and sought to destroy their
liberty. Courage nerved every arm, valor moved every
heart. They thought only of punishing their foes and
bringing ruin and destruction on these men who had
oftentimes, with ruthless barbarity, inflicted grievous
wrongs upon their kinsmen and countrymen.</p>

<p>The turnpike passed in front of the church. Upon
the road Major Gibson drew up his men in column.
When they heard the firing and saw the galloping
cavalrymen, they did not at first understand the situation,
but as the surging crowd came closer they observed
the Federals and Confederates in undistinguishable
confusion. As the Confederates were riding
toward the rear guard and these were in a gallop, the
latter could not use their carbines. At the gait they
were going it was impossible to aim and fire with the
least assurance of hitting anybody.</p>

<p>The pursuit was rapid and fierce. The fleeing enemy
were helpless. The Confederates were moved to savage
onslaught and resolved to kill and slay with all the
abandon that war creates. There were few of the
Confederate riders that did not have some wrong to
avenge, and to these there was no better time than the
present. There were at first no calls for surrender.
There was no chance for parley. War meant fighting,
and fighting meant killing those who opposed. The
Federals had no chance to turn and ask for their lives.
The time in this battle had not yet come for this cry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span>
The Confederates rode into the files of the Federals
with their pistols in hand; they shot as they rode, and
they made no distinction among their foes. When one
file of the Confederates exhausted their shots another
took their place. There was no let up in punishing the
fleeing Federals. When the loads were all used, they
reversed their revolvers and knocked their foes from
their steeds with the butt end of their weapons. The
hotly pursued rear guard, under Captain Duff, had no
time to tell Major Gibson of what had happened.
The turnpike went down the mountain, and that was
open. If they turned aside they knew not what might
come, and when they saw Major Gibson’s men drawn
up in line ready for the fray, it came into their minds
that he was better prepared than they were to deal
with these men in gray who were riding and firing
with devilish vehemence, so the rear guard galloped
on by.</p>

<p>It was a perplexing sight to see these men of opposite
sides thus mingling in combat, and the soldiers
in Major Gibson’s line looked with amazement at the
confusion, pursuit and flight.</p>

<p>The men of the rear guard had no time to inform
Major Gibson of the situation; the men with Major
Richards were not disposed to pass them by, and the
thirty-eight Confederates responded to the command
to turn and attack the column waiting by the roadside.
The men with Richards veered to the right and
galloped into the midst of Gibson’s men, pushed their
revolvers into the faces of the surprised Federals and
opened a furious and murderous attack.</p>

<p>The assault was so unexpected and so savage that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span>
it disorganized Major Gibson’s line. Richards’ men
broke through the column and severed it in twain, and
then a panic struck the Federal force. Its men, demoralized,
quickly followed the madly fleeing Federal
rear guard down the mountain side. Another chance
was now opened up. It was seven miles to the Shenandoah
River, and the Federals, unless they re-formed,
could expect no respite or safety until this stream was
passed. It would require an hour for the Federals, in
this race for life, to reach the ford, and until then there
was little hope of escape from danger, capture and
death.</p>

<p>The Federals could not use their carbines with one
hand, while the Confederates could hold their bridles
with their left hands and fire their revolvers with their
right. Part of Major Gibson’s men were shot down
before they could even offer resistance or turn in flight.
In an instant, the Federals began to give way and
started down the side of the mountain, along which
only two men could ride abreast. The moment the
retreat was begun it became headlong. Again and
again brave officers in blue attempted to stay the
flight. A few men would halt by the wayside, but the
feeling of the hour with the Federals was to escape,
and it was impossible to get enough Federals together
to stop the stampede.</p>

<p>As the Confederate advance guard fired their
revolvers into the backs of the retreating foe, they
would either drop back and reload their weapon, or
else those behind them who had full cylinders would
ride up and continue the fire into the fleeing enemy.
In the wild chase of the Federals the Confederates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
observed one on a dun horse. He was brave and was
fighting desperately to protect the rear of his men,
and urging them to halt and face their foe. When
Major Richards observed that the efforts of this Federal
soldier were having some effect upon his comrades,
he called to two of his soldiers, Sidney Ferguson and
Charles Dear, to “kill the man on the dun horse.”
This person had not bargained for this singling out
of himself as a target for Confederate shots. When
these ominous words fell upon his ears, he put spurs
to his horse and in a reckless frenzy forged his way past
his comrades and was not afterwards seen in the rout.
The two Confederates who were endeavoring to capture
or kill the man on the dun horse, at this point made
Lieutenant Baker of General Merritt’s staff a prisoner.
This rapid and relentless following was continued for
seven miles down the narrow road, and it only ended
on the banks of the Shenandoah River. Scattered
along the highway were wounded and dead animals.
Thirteen Federal troopers were still in death on the
roadside. Sixty-four prisoners were taken and more
than ninety horses captured. Captain Duff, the commander
of the rear guard, was among the wounded
prisoners. Among the revolvers captured was one
with Colonel Harry Gilmor’s name carved upon the
guard. Reading this inscription, Major Richards
asked Lieutenant Baker, his prisoner, how the Federals
happened to have this pistol, and he was then informed
for the first time that Colonel Gilmor had been captured.</p>

<p>Major Gibson, the Federal commandant, was among
the few who escaped. He reported his misfortune to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
General Merritt. It is published in Series 1, Volume 46,
Part 1, Page 463, of the Records of the Rebellion.
He said:</p>

<p>“I placed Captain Duff in charge of the rear guard,
which consisted of forty men. I made the rear guard so
strong, in proportion to the size of my command,
owing to the enemy’s repeated and vigorous attacks
on it. I was at the head of the column, and turned
around in order to observe the condition of the column,
and looking to the rear, I observed several men hold
up their hands and make gestures which I supposed
were intended to inform me that the rear was attacked.
I immediately ordered the command, ‘right into line.’</p>

<p>“No sooner had I issued these commands than I
saw Captain Duff and his party at the rear of the small
party who marched in the rear of the led horses. Captain
Duff’s command was coming at a run. I saw
rebels among and in the rear of his party, charging.
I ordered the command forward, fired a volley and
ordered a charge, which the men did not complete.
Captain Duff in the meantime was trying to rally his
men in the rear of my line. Before his men had reloaded
their pieces, I had fired another volley and ordered
another charge.... The charge was met by
one from the enemy and the command was broken.
The men had no weapons but their carbines, and these
were extremely difficult to load, and inefficient in the
melee that ensued. I made every effort, as did Captain
Duff and Captain Martindale and Lieutenant Baker,
of the corps staff, to re-form the men, but our efforts
were fruitless. The rebels had very few sabres, but
were well supplied with revolvers, and rode up to our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
men and shot them down, without meeting more
resistance than men could make with carbines. There
was a small ridge overlooking both parties, through
which the path led. I rode up to the side of this and
formed the advance guard, which had returned to aid
me. The enemy were amidst the men, and both
parties were so mixed up that it was impossible to get
the men in line. As fast as the men could force their
horses into the path, where many of the men were
crowded together, they broke for the river. I waited
until I was surrounded, and only a half a dozen men
left around; the balance had retreated toward the river,
or were killed, wounded or captured. Captain Martindale,
as he left, said to me: ‘It is useless to attempt to
rally the men here; we’ll try it farther on.’ I tried to
ride to the front. Men were crowded into the path by
twos and threes where there was really only room for
one to ride. Men were being thrown and being crushed
as they lay on the ground, by others; they were falling
from their horses from the enemy’s fire in front and rear
of me. I rode past about twenty of the men and again
tried to rally the men, but all my efforts were fruitless.</p>

<p>“... I was ordered to surrender, two of the
enemy in advance endeavoring to beat me off my horse
with their pistols.... I reached the river; my horse
fell several times in it, but at last I got across. Captain
Martindale forced most of the men across to halt and
form here, and cover the crossing of the few who had
reached the river. Captain Martindale, myself, two
scouts and twelve men were saved. We waited to see
if more would come, but none came; eight had crossed
and arrived at camp before us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span></p>

<p>Major Gibson, in accounting for his disaster, says
that his men being armed with carbines alone were
“unable to engage in a melee successfully with an enemy
armed with at least two revolvers to the man; also,
I didn’t know of the attack until I observed the rear
guard coming in at full flight, mixed up with and pursued
by the enemy.” He concluded his report by asking
for a “court of inquiry at the earliest practicable
moment.”</p>

<p>Colonel George Taylor Denison, who long held a
leading commission as a Canadian Cavalry officer, in
his book on “Modern Cavalry,” describes the results
of this battle as one of the most remarkable in the history
of cavalry warfare. He asserts the fight of Mosby’s
men at Mt. Carmel Church demonstrated the superiority
of the pistol and revolver above all other weapons
in cavalry combat, when these are in the hands of men
who know how to use them.</p>

<p>The Confederates pursued the fleeing foe right up
to the Shenandoah River. With his limited force
Major Richards deemed it unwise to cross that stream.
He marched back with his followers over the Blue
Ridge Mountains to Paris, a little town in the northernmost
part of Fauquier County. In this immediate
neighborhood, and about Upperville, there had been
many engagements between cavalry on both sides.
Some of the severest cavalry fighting of the war occurred
in this vicinity a few days after the Battle of
Fleetwood Hill. Stuart and Pleasanton were for three
days in contact about Upperville, Middleburg and
Aldie, but none of these, considering the number engaged,
were so brilliant as this conflict between Major<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
Gibson and Major Richards. Only two Confederates
were wounded and none killed. This gallant fight was
complimented by General Lee in a dispatch to the War
Department.</p>

<p>As the Federals left the home of Major Richards’
father, they took with them his uniform and his
other trappings. When he emerged from the trap
door there was nothing left for him to wear. The
Federal soldiers had taken everything that they could
lay their hands upon, hoping thereby to make the
Major ride thereafter with a limited wardrobe. They
wished also to exhibit them as a trophy won from
Mosby’s men.</p>

<p>Searching around, Major Richards found an old-fashioned,
high top, black felt hat, badly worn and
with many holes around the brim. He managed to
secure a suit of brown Kentucky jeans and a pair of
laborer’s boots which had been discarded by some farm
hand. Lacking an overcoat, his mother pinned her
woolen shawl about his shoulders. It was not a very
attractive garb. It might have served in a pinch for an
infantryman, but it did not sit well upon a dashing
cavalryman.</p>

<p>When Richards’ command reached Paris the Federal
prisoners had been corralled in an old blacksmith
shop. While resting there the Confederate commander
was informed that one of the prisoners desired
to speak with him. When Major Richards arrived at
the blacksmith shop, the courier indicated a handsomely
dressed young officer as the one who had sent
the message seeking an interview. The Confederate
commander asked why he had been sent for. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>
Federal officer, surprised at the appearance of the
Confederate, not then twenty-one years of age, said to
Major Richards: “I desire to speak to the commanding
officer.” Major Richards, in his pride of achievement,
forgot the sorry appearance he was making in the cast-off
clothing of the farm hand, and calmly looking the
Federal in the eye, he said to him: “I am the commanding
officer.” The lieutenant, amazed, gazed carefully
at the stripling, so grotesquely clad. He was too
astounded to be able to speak. Waiting a brief time,
Major Richards, in order to relieve the embarrassment,
said, “Well, what is it you want?” The Federal lieutenant
then informed the major that there was a
captain among the prisoners who was severely wounded,
and he wished to know if he could not be properly
cared for. The solicitude of the wounded man’s comrade
appealed to the finer sentiments of the Confederate.
Learning the name of the Federal captain, he
directed him to be paroled and removed to the village
hotel and placed under the care of the neighborhood
physician, and directed that the bills for medical
attention and board be sent to him for payment.</p>

<p>After this preliminary had been arranged, Major
Richards turned to the lieutenant and said, “I notice
you are wearing a staff officer’s uniform;” to which
response was made: “Yes, I am a lieutenant on General
Merritt’s staff.” Then the Confederate commander
asked, “How did you happen to be in this command?”
The Federal replied that he had been sent with the
orders under which Major Gibson was to make this
raid, and he asked General Merritt to permit him to
go along just for the fun of it; to which the Confederate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
replied: “I hope, Lieutenant, you have enjoyed it more
than your surroundings seem to indicate.”</p>

<p>The wounded officer was Captain Duff, who had
commanded the rear guard. He speedily recovered
and was permitted to return to his home. In later
years when statements were made that Mosby had
mistreated his prisoners, the grateful captain made a
vigorous defense of Mosby and his men, and extolled
both their humanity and their mercy.</p>

MORGAN’S CHRISTMAS RAID, DECEMBER 22,<br>
1862, TO JANUARY 2, 1863</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The distance between Nashville and Murfreesboro
is thirty miles. For sixty days after assuming
command of the Federal forces at Nashville,
General Rosecrans was making his preparations to
advance south. The Confederate Army was at Murfreesboro.
The center, under General Leonidas Polk,
around the town; the right wing, under General McCown,
at Readyville, ten miles east of Murfreesboro;
and the left wing at Triune and Eaglesville, under
General W. J. Hardee, ten miles west of Murfreesboro.
These comprised the entire Confederate Army called
the “Army of Tennessee.” It was in front of the
Federal forces, styled the “Army of the Cumberland,”
and covered the lines around Murfreesboro.</p>

<p>General Rosecrans took with him out of Nashville
forty-seven thousand men. He had seventy-five hundred
at Nashville, thirty-five hundred at Gallatin and
four thousand at Bowling Green, Kentucky, and
Clarksville, Tennessee. General Bragg, all counted,
had thirty-eight thousand men to resist the Federal
advance.</p>

<p>Between Murfreesboro and Nashville there was a
macadam road. Along this, Rosecrans advanced, and
it took him four days to get close enough to Murfreesboro
to justify an attack on the part of the Confederates.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
The outlook to the Federals was flattering. On the
afternoon of the 30th, General Palmer, who was commanding
the Union vanguard, telegraphed that he was
“in sight of Murfreesboro and the enemy was running.”
On the next day, he discovered that this was a great
mistake, and when he felt the impact of the Confederates
on the 31st, he realized that if “the men in gray
were running,” they had suddenly changed their mind
and their ways. The four days consumed by Rosecrans
in making this twenty miles were full of intense
activities. Generals Wheeler and Wharton of the Confederate
cavalry were the potent factors in delaying
and embarrassing the Federal movements.</p>

<p>No one in the Confederate service knew better than
General Wheeler how to obstruct an advancing foe.
On the 26th, 27th, 28th and 29th, he harassed and assailed
the Federals at every opportunity and made them
hesitant and extremely cautious.</p>

<p>At midnight, on the 29th of December, General
Wheeler was ordered by General Bragg to ride around
the Federal Army. It was only a thirty-five mile
dash, but it had much of excitement, danger and difficulty.
On the morning of the 30th, Wheeler reported
that he had captured a brigade train and fifty prisoners.
At Lavergne, a few hours later, he took seven hundred
prisoners and destroyed an immense train. This
carried with it a loss to the Federals in supplies and
munitions of many hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Nearby, at Rock Springs, he caught another train.
At Nolensville he captured still another and three
hundred prisoners, and then without any disturbance
from his foes, he proceeded to take his place on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span>
left wing of the Confederate Army. In these brief
hours he had swung the circle and deeply impressed
on his opponents that they might expect trouble at
every step of their way.</p>

<p>At dawn of the day following, General McCown
opened the Battle of Murfreesboro. General Wheeler,
with his cavalry, joined in the attack on the Federals
and aided in driving them two miles. General Wharton,
with the other portion of the Southern cavalry, was
ordered also to ride to the rear of the enemy. He captured
hundreds of prisoners, and as if defying all rules
of safety, he turned the head of his column due north,
in the direction of Nashville. He destroyed many
wagons and made numerous prisoners. A large majority
of those he safely delivered within the Confederate
lines. The Federals had good guns; Wharton, inferior
ones. He immediately provided his two thousand riders
with the improved arms which had been taken from
the Federals, and then returned to the rear of the enemy,
passing entirely around the Federal forces. These
successes inspired every man in Bragg’s army with
courage and hope. The example of these bold horsemen
was contagious, and the infantry were anxious to try
their luck with the invading columns.</p>

<p>Not satisfied with these adventures, on the 1st day
of January, General Wheeler with his own and Wharton’s
cavalry, decided to return to the rear of the Federal
Army, where there was such rich reward for his
labors. Revisiting Lavergne, he attacked the garrison,
burned many wagons and captured a number of infantry
and a splendid piece of artillery. Fate was so
propitious in all these expeditions and the field for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span>
destruction so wide, the same night he again went
to Rosecrans’ rear, capturing a large number of wagons
and horses and prisoners, and by two o’clock the next
morning was on the left flank of the army. At nine
o’clock on the night of the 1st, he made his last expedition
to the Federal rear, and, as before, found his foes
easily demoralized and ready to flee or surrender when
vigorously and promptly assailed. On the 4th of
January, after these adventurous and successful operations,
he emerged from his Federal surroundings to
find that General Bragg had fallen back. No cavalry
in any great battle of the war played a more distinguished
part than Wheeler’s and Wharton’s men at
Murfreesboro. Their audacity was only equalled by
their success, and it is difficult to comprehend how
even the greatest of leaders, with only twenty-nine
hundred horsemen, could make such havoc with foes,
or move with such ease, celerity and with freedom
from disaster, in the rear of an opposing army, when
rarely was he at any time more than ten miles from the
tents of its commanders. A few hundreds of Federal
cavalry properly led and disposed, with such numbers
of infantry close by, ought not only to have obstructed
Generals Wheeler and Wharton in their marches,
but should have forced or driven them discomfited
within their own lines. In the battle the Federal losses
in killed and wounded was eight thousand, seven hundred
and seventy-eight and three thousand six hundred
and seventy-three captured, making a total of twelve
thousand four hundred and fifty-one. Rosecrans also
lost twenty-eight pieces of artillery. Bragg, with
thirty-eight thousand men, had a loss of ten thousand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span>
two hundred and sixty-six, of which nine thousand
were killed and wounded, and about twelve hundred
of them were left in the hospitals at Murfreesboro,
which later were taken possession of by the Federal
Army.</p>

<p>A third of the forces in this battle were from Tennessee.
They fought desperately on their native soil, contesting
for their homes and firesides, and they suffered a
terrific decimation. Cheatham’s division, composed entirely
of Tennesseeans, had thirty-six per cent wounded
or killed. Cleburne’s division suffered a like mortality,
and Johnson’s and Palmer’s Tennessee brigades sustained
a loss of twenty-nine and a half per cent.</p>

<p>In order to prevent reinforcements at Clarksville,
Nashville and Bowling Green from coming to the assistance
of Rosecrans, General John H. Morgan was
directed by General Bragg on the 22d of December,
1862, to make a raid along the Louisville and Nashville
railroad into Kentucky, and, as far as possible, destroy
it, so as to break the Federal communications.</p>

<p>Alexandria, in Wilson County, Tennessee, was forty
miles east of Nashville. The Federals did not spread
out very far from Nashville in this direction, and there
was a neutral zone in and around Lebanon, the county
seat of Wilson County, to which the Federals and Confederates
each now and then came. It was necessary
to protect this line in order to prevent danger to Knoxville.
It was still in the nominal possession of the Confederacy.
South and west of Nashville, Wheeler,
Wharton and Forrest were campaigning. Forrest’s
December raid into West Tennessee had not only
demonstrated that he was one of the most ferocious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
fighters in the Confederate service, but also the tremendous
power of cavalry when skillfully handled.
He had largely recruited his skeleton regiments, and
when he came out, although he had seen hard service,
he numbered several hundred more men than when he
was ordered, against his judgment, by General Bragg
to make the raid, in the face of most inclement weather
and with an ill-equipped force. His personal pride
had been subordinated to his patriotism, and he was
ready to give and do his best for the work now before
Bragg.</p>

<p>Morgan was now to be given a chance to try his
hand in Kentucky. For some months there had been
no material interruption of the Louisville and Nashville
railroad, and Rosecrans was using it and the Cumberland
River to supply his army at Nashville. General
Bragg was perfectly familiar with the preparations
that Rosecrans was making for the advance of his
army southward, and he knew that a decisive battle
could not be long delayed.</p>

<p>General Morgan’s name was now on every tongue.
His July raid from Knoxville into Kentucky, where he
had marched a thousand miles, destroyed millions
of dollars worth of property, and terrorized a district
three hundred miles long and sixty miles wide, his
services during the invasion of Kentucky by General
Bragg, and his splendid exhibition of genius demonstrated
in covering General Bragg’s retreat from Kentucky
in October, and the Battle of Hartsville had
given him not only a well-deserved but wide reputation.
The things he had done were along new lines and everywhere
created wonder and admiration. The Battle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span>
of Hartsville, one of the most brilliant exploits in the
history of the Confederacy, resulted in Morgan’s being
advanced to brigadier general. Seven days after the
Hartsville expedition, General Morgan was married to
Miss Ready, of Murfreesboro, among the most brilliant,
charming and attractive women of the Southland.
There were those at the time who predicted that this
marriage, under the circumstances surrounding Morgan’s
military career, would affect his success. Be this
as it may, this splendid woman enthusiastically entered
into the military hopes and ambitions of her now greatly
distinguished husband, and moved and inspired with
the loyalty and courage that filled the hearts of the
women of the South, urged rather than restrained the
enterprise and activity of her companion.</p>

<p>Morgan always did best when he was allowed to
act independently. When operating his own way and
managing his campaigns, he was one of the most successful,
dangerous and destructive of Confederate cavalry
leaders. Full of resource, glorying in adventure, he
imbued his men with his marvelous fervor and passionate
ardor. Within a few days after his promotion to
brigadier general, his forces were materially strengthened.
Colonels W. C. P. Breckinridge and Robert G.
Stoner each recruited battalions in Kentucky in the
fall of 1862. These were now consolidated and thereafter
known as the 9th Kentucky Cavalry, with Breckinridge
as colonel and Stoner as lieutenant colonel.
Toward the end of September Colonel Adam R. Johnson
reached Murfreesboro with a regiment which he
had recruited in Western Kentucky, of about four
hundred men. It had been battered by service, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>
received rough handling in the Federal lines, but had a
splendid organization. Its lieutenant colonel, Robert
M. Martin, was confessedly one of the most daring
and dashing of the men who wore the Confederate
uniform. The brigade was now thirty-nine hundred
strong. The misfortunes of war had dismounted some
of the troops, and part of them were not fully armed,
but all knew that the next raid would remedy these
deficiencies. Morgan divided his regiments into two
brigades, the first under command of General Basil W.
Duke, Colonel of the 2d Kentucky, and the second
under command of Colonel W. C. P. Breckinridge, of
the 9th Kentucky. Colonel A. R. Johnson was at this
time considered the ranking colonel, and when offered
by General Morgan the command of the second brigade,
declined it, preferring to act as colonel of the 10th
Kentucky. Later, however, he accepted promotion to a
brigadier.</p>

<p>Then, many believed that Colonel Roy S. Cluke, of
the 8th Kentucky, should have been made brigadier general,
and it is said that his raid into Kentucky, which
followed in February and March, 1863, was projected
in order to equalize things on account of Colonel Cluke
being ranked at this time by Colonels Breckinridge
and Johnson. Both Cluke and Johnson hesitating,
Morgan appointed Breckinridge to command the
second brigade. The first was composed of the 2d
Kentucky, Duke’s, the 3d Kentucky, Gano’s, the 8th
Kentucky, Cluke’s, with Palmer’s battery of four
pieces. The second was composed of the 9th Kentucky,
Breckinridge’s, the 10th Kentucky, Johnson’s, the 11th,
Chenault’s, and the 14th Tennessee under Colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span>
Bennett. These had a Parrott gun and two mountain
howitzers. By November, 1862, Morgan’s forces had
reached in equipment and numbers a very high grade
of efficiency. True, there were some unmounted and
unarmed men, but these could be used as horse holders,
and as out of every four men, one must hold horses,
when four thousand cavalrymen should go into battle,
one thousand of them would have to remain at the rear
with the animals while the other three-fourths dismounted
to fight.</p>

<p>For a few days preceding the 21st, the farriers were
busy shoeing the horses. Equipments were inspected
with minutest scrutiny. Ammunition was counted
out, the mounts were carefully examined, as only
soldiers and horses that could stand a strenuous and
long drawn out expedition were to be taken. These
men and beasts were to be subjected to the rigors of
storms, travel and cold that would try out the highest
resistance of flesh and blood to nature’s warfare.
These preparations the rank and file knew portended
immediate and intense activity. The division then
comprised a remarkable body of young men. It represented
a full share of the chivalry and flower of the
states of Kentucky and Tennessee. Lawyers, physicians,
farmers, clerks, and here and there clergymen
were either officers or in the ranks. A large proportion
of these were liberally educated. Intelligent and patriotic
and full of the spirit of adventure and romance
which attached to cavalry, they were ready for any
service and always would go without fear where duty
called. They were proud, and that made them brave.
The vast majority of the men were under twenty-five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span>
years of age, and youth always makes the best soldiers
if the material and leadership are good.</p>

<p>On the morning of December 22d, in and around the
little town of Alexandria, the lines of the divisions were
formed. The Kentuckians sat astride their horses
most anxiously, longing for the command to move.
They looked and acted like men who understood that
work was cut out for them.</p>

<p>In a brief while a general order from their leader
was read. There was no longer any reason for concealment.
In a few moments they knew they were going
into Kentucky, and the hope and promise of home-going
caused the blood to tingle in their veins and their hearts
to beat with quickened rapture and joy. These boys
could guess the path they would follow, and the confidence
of their commander added new courage to their
hearts. He told them candidly where they were going;
he reminded them who they were, and he impressed
upon them what was expected of them. Prolonged and
vociferous cheering was heard when the order was read,
and the hills and the woods were filled with the glad
shouts of these exiled youths who were now to turn
their faces homeward. With wild hurrahs they expressed
their delight, and with exultant outcries gave
dauntless response to the call of their chieftain. The
one Tennessee regiment felt the spirit of the hour.
Though going from home, they caught the delirium of
joy that thrilled these horsemen, now commencing one
of the great marches of a great war.</p>

<p>From Alexandria for some distance there was a
good road. In a little over two hours the column had
covered eight miles. Suddenly the stillness of the march<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span>
was disturbed. The men far up in front heard, away
to the rear, triumphant yells and tremendous cheering.
They knew what this meant. Morgan was coming.
Alongside the column, with a splendid staff, magnificently
mounted, superbly dressed, riding like a centaur,
bare-headed, with plumed hat in his right hand, waving
salutations to his applauding followers, the general
came galloping by. Pride and happiness were radiated
from every feature of his joyous face. He was now a
brigadier general, and new opportunity was opened to
add to his already superb fame. He had just been
married to one of the most beautiful and gracious women
of the South. As he released himself from her
tender embrace and felt the touch of her lovely lips
upon his own and saw the tear-drops trickle down her
cheek, painted by the delicate touch of nature with
most exquisite colors, he caught an inspiration that
lifted him up to the sublimest heights of human heroism,
and imbued him with a valor that stirred every
fibre of his soul, and made him feel that with him there
must be victory or death. He had with him four
thousand Kentucky boys, well armed, for so large a
force well mounted, and there spread out before his
enraptured fancy scenes of conquest and glory that
filled his mind with ecstasy and delight. There was
in such an hour of splendor no omen of the gloom and
darkness of the future, and no signal came to warn
of the time when, a few months later, by war’s harsh
and cruel edict, his hopes would be shattered, when his
dead body would be mutilated by his vengeful foes and
the weeping wife and an unborn babe would feel forever
the rude shock of the awful bereavement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span></p>

<p>No time was now to be wasted. Every moment
must count. To do the work that he had undertaken
and to do it well meant that he must ride like the whirlwind
and march like the storm. Biting cold, drenching
rains, chilling sleet, were not to be considered. Rapid
night rides, days without food, sleepless watchings,
ceaseless vigils, constant battle, fording or swimming
rivers, and defiance of nature’s protest and barriers,
held out no terrors for these high-spirited riders. All
believed that leaders and men were invincible and that
a generous fate would protect and guard them in
whatever dangers and difficulties the fortunes of war
would bring, on the campaign to which their country
and Cause had bid them come.</p>

<p>By the night of the 22d, the first brigade had forded
the Cumberland River at Sand Shoal, and at dawn the
second had crossed the stream. There were not enough
rations to require long delays for feeding. The horses
ravenously munched the meagre supply of corn and
fodder that had been impressed to satisfy their hunger.
By sundown the column had covered thirty miles.
There was heavy work ahead. They would meet and
attack Federal garrisons who were in stockades and
forts. This made it necessary to have the artillery;
but the guns, however important, slowed down the
speed of the march.</p>

<p>By the 6th of May, 1862, Andrew Johnson had
spoken savagely of Morgan and his men. In writing
to Horace Maynard, Member of Congress, he said:
“Morgan’s marauding gang should not be admitted
to the rules of civilised warfare, and the portion of his
forces taken at Lebanon should not be held as prisoners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span>
of war. I hope you will call attention of Secretary
Stanton to the fact of their being a mere band of freebooters.”
The seven months that had transpired since
this utterance had not increased the good opinion of
the Federals concerning Morgan’s brigades. The
Union forces were so much afraid of General Morgan
and talked so much of his exploits and his expeditions
that they created in the minds of the public, who did
not sympathize with the South, a most exaggerated and
ridiculous idea of him and his men. They were singing
and talking of “Morgan, Morgan and his terrible men.”</p>

<p>By the 24th of December Morgan had reached up
into Barren County, five miles from Glasgow and ninety
miles from the place where he had started. Two companies
were sent forward to secure information of
conditions at Glasgow. One of these was commanded
by Captain William E. Jones of the 9th Kentucky
Cavalry. About this time the advance guard of a
battalion of the 2d Michigan Cavalry entered the place
upon the opposite side from that which Jones had come
in. As both parties were looking for trouble, it did not
take long to bring on a fight, and they met about the
center of the town. Jones was mortally wounded,
and William Webb, of Breckinridge’s regiment, one
of the best men in Kentucky, fell in the conflict. In
the melee Lieutenant Samuel O. Peyton, of the 2d
Kentucky, was wounded, having been shot in the arm
and hip. His foes, gathering around him, demanded
his surrender. He fired his revolver, killing one of his
assailants, grappled with the second, threw him to the
ground and stabbed him to death with his knife. The
Federals were not expecting such a reception or such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span>
resistance, and so within a very few minutes, they were
driven away. Twenty-two prisoners, including a
captain, were captured and paroled. The gage of
battle had been thrown down and conflict must be
expected at any moment. The command was in a
territory where both garrisons and obstructing and
opposing forces would be vigilant and aggressive, and
where every energy of the Federal authorities was put
under stern requisition to harass and delay or destroy
this Confederate force, which on mischief and devastation
bent, in the face of winter’s defiance, and far from
supports, was offering battle’s wage to those who stood
in their pathway of ruin and destruction.</p>

<p>The roads had now become better. There was a
turnpike leading from Glasgow toward Louisville.
Mysteriously Morgan’s coming had been known to
the citizens. The entire length of the Louisville &amp; Nashville
Railroad was thickly studded with stockades, and
every bridge of any importance had a full guard, and
towns like Elizabethtown and Munfordsville, Bowling
Green and Shepherdsville were all protected by strong
garrisons. The great importance of the Louisville &amp;
Nashville Railroad as a means of feeding and supplying
the Federal Army at Nashville and below, demanded
that it should be fully and thoroughly defended, and no
small force could hope to avail against this thorough
preparation on the part of the Federals for the guarding
of this essential highway.</p>

<p>Captain Quirk, in command of the advance guard
and the scouts, had not gone very far until he found a
battery across the road and supports on either side.
An impetuous attack was the answer to this challenge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span>
and it did not require very long to brush this obstruction
out of the Confederate path. Johnson’s regiment
had been sent in the direction of Munfordsville to
threaten that place, but General Morgan turned his
forces south and east of the Green River, which was
not forded without much difficulty. The banks were
steep and muddy and the water high enough to give
great inconvenience. As there was a long railroad
bridge at Munfordsville, a strong Federal garrison had
been gathered at that point to defend it. His force
was not large enough to assault the earthworks protecting
this structure. General Morgan had determined
to destroy the trestles at Muldraugh Hill, six
miles north of Elizabethtown. The damage there
would more than equal any he could inflict at Munfordsville.
It was of importance that he should create
upon the minds of the Federals the impression that he
would assail the garrison at Munfordsville and force
them to concentrate there, when his men should reach
the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad between Munfordsville
and Elizabethtown, and bridges and culverts torn
up, there need not be any particular worry about the
Federal forces in the rear. Infantry would have to be
moved along the railroad and they would stand a
slight chance to catch Morgan and his horsemen on
lines removed from the thoroughfare. Little sleep was
allowed that night. On the morrow General Morgan
had mapped out great work. He intended to take the
stockades at Bacon’s Creek and Nolin River and destroy
the bridges there. During the night a tremendous
rain had fallen, and all day it still kept coming down
in torrents. The cannon and caissons in the mud and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</span>
slush made slow progress and prevented very rapid
movement. A regiment had been despatched to Bacon’s
Creek bridge, and at eleven o’clock the cannonading
there was distinctly heard. It was necessary to
reduce the stockade and capture the Federal garrison
at that point in order to prevent the Federals from sending
new troops to Nashville.</p>

<p>The force sent thither not returning delayed the
march, and it was three o’clock before it got under way.
General Morgan took the reinforcements that had
arrived from the feint toward Munfordsville, and he
went over with these to learn what was the cause of
the detention at Bacon’s Creek. Upon his arrival,
peremptory demand was made by him for surrender,
and the Federal forces under Captain James of the
19th Illinois promptly complied. The stockade was
immediately burned and the torch applied to the
trestle. The garrison at Nolin was less disposed to
fight than those at Bacon’s Creek, and these laid down
their arms without resistance. The stockade and
bridge were consigned to the flames. Great fires were
built along the tracks of the Louisville &amp; Nashville
for several miles, the iron rails, torn from the ties,
were placed upon these and were warped and bent
so as to be unfit for use until carried to a rolling
mill.</p>

<p>On the morning of December 27th General Morgan
learned of the presence of a considerable force at
Elizabethtown, and moved over to that place. When
within a short distance of the town a most ludicrous
communication was sent out under a flag of truce.
It ran somewhat like this: “Elizabethtown, Kentucky,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span>
December 27th, 1862. To the commander of the
Confederate forces: I have you surrounded and will
compel you to surrender. I am, sir, your obedient
servant, H. S. Smith, Commander United States
Forces.” General Morgan smiled and chuckled.
He informed the bearer of this extraordinary despatch
that he trusted he would convey the impression to his
commander that the positions were reversed, that it
was the Federal forces that were to surrender and not
the Confederates, and he requested their immediate
capitulation, to which he received the rather unique
reply that “it was the business of a United States
officer to fight and not to surrender.” As nothing
but a fight would satisfy the six hundred and seventy
men under command of Colonel Smith, General Morgan
prepared to give him what he wanted. Surrounding
the town, skirmishers were thrown forward and the
position of the enemy developed. He had taken position
in brick houses on the outside of the town and resolved
to have a street fight. The Federals had no
artillery, and the Confederates had seven pieces. It
was a very unequal contest. The Confederates marched
boldly in. They had seen street fighting before.
Colonel Cluke and Lieutenant Colonel Stoner, who
later at Mount Sterling in February and March were
to win additional fame, entered the town at the head
of their men. A few well-directed shells convinced
the Federals of the folly of resistance. The gallant
Federal colonel still refused to surrender, but his men,
rushing out, displayed the white flag, and left him to
his fate. Six hundred and fifty-two prisoners, including
twenty-five officers, were the result of this fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</span></p>

<p>The great prize for which the Confederates were
contending was yet six miles away. Two mighty
trestles, one nine hundred and one a thousand feet long
and ninety feet high, were the means by which the
Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad climbed Muldraugh’s
Hill and debauched on the Elizabethtown side of that
small mountain range. The bridges and trestles
heretofore destroyed were small in comparison to these
two immense structures. Both of these trestles were
defended by garrisons, and both were well fortified.
These troops had been especially ordered to fight to
the last ditch. Seven hundred men had been placed
to guard these giant viaducts. They were the highest
and most valuable on the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad,
and the Confederates had never been able to reach
them before. Full stores had been collected at this
point. On this expedition Captains Palmer and
Corbett handled the artillery with consummate skill
and bravery. Their well-directed shots in a brief while
brought both garrisons to terms. The flames ascending
high into the air told the story of the victory and triumph
of the Confederate forces, and the columns of
smoke lifting their shadows up toward the heavens
proclaimed to the pursuers that the dreaded calamity
had overtaken the all-important trestles which meant
so much to the railway, and that they had gone down
before the avenging hand of enemies. Small forces
were sent out a few miles north toward Shepherdsville
and destroyed some unimportant structures. General
Morgan had wrecked the road now for something like
fifty miles. Nothing inflammable had escaped the
touch of his destructive torch. Having accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span>
all they had intended to do, with Federal forces south
and southeast and others in the path in every direction,
he now faced the problem of safely escaping from these
foes which beleaguered and beset him on every side.
He had now reached one hundred and seventy miles
into the enemy’s territory. He had destroyed twenty-three
hundred feet of bridging and put the railroad
out of commission for many weeks.</p>

<p>In cavalry experiences it is sometimes easier to get
in than to get out. The whole country south and east
of Morgan was aroused. The Federal commanders at
Washington and Nashville were beginning to question
with vehement pertinacity how Morgan had been allowed
to ride so far and do so much damage without
serious interruption. It was true that the defenders at
Bacon’s Creek were not very numerous, that those at
Nolin were less so, and that those at Elizabethtown
and the Muldraugh trestles had no chance against the
well-directed artillery of the Confederates, backed by
thirty-five hundred cavalry; but up in Louisville,
at Nashville, at Washington, Morgan seemed to be
going where he pleased and doing what he pleased.
At these centers, so far removed from the scene of his
action, it appeared that those who were opposing him,
or following, were neither diligent nor brave. The
men at Washington, Louisville, or Nashville were not
marching in the cold, or riding through the mud and
the rain. They could not take in the surroundings of
the men who were at work on the spot, and so they
became both inquisitive and critical. General Morgan,
however, was not underrating the efforts of his foes
to minimize the damage he might do or to prevent his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span>escape. Great soldier as he was, he foresaw what he
must face and overcome when he turned his face
southward and undertook to break through the cordon
his enemies were establishing around him. He had
before him for outlet a territory sixty miles wide,
filled with numerous highways. Nearly all these were
merely country roads, which when cut by his artillery
and churned by the sixteen thousand feet of the
horses his men were riding, would be only streams of
mire.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="p493" style="max-width: 38.25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">MAP SHOWING APPROXIMATELY MORGAN’S CHRISTMAS RAID</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Mud and slush would face him along any line he
should march except one, and that was through Bardstown
and Springfield, Lebanon and Campbellsville.
Lebanon was on the railroad and it could be promptly
and largely reinforced. The Confederate chieftain was
too great a leader to be trapped. He realized that he
must go higher up the Cumberland in the first place,
and find another crossing, and in the second place to
get out of the line of those who were bent on his destruction.
The Federal leaders did not seem to be in a
very great hurry. He turned southeast and on the
night of the 28th of December camped on the Rolling
Fork, a tributary of Salt River. This was a deep and
ordinarily a sluggish stream, with high banks. The
rain, a few days before, had filled its bed with angry
currents and good fords were infrequent, and particularly
fords that would let artillery over. There was a
peculiar pride in part of the artillery that made the
command ready to fight savagely for them. One of the
pieces was a Parrott gun, a trophy of their valor at
Hartsville. It was called “Long Tom” because of its
extreme length. Closely associated with the victory at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span>
Hartsville, it became a great pet of the division, and
was treasured as a mascot.</p>

<p>In the midst of the exciting surroundings of the
campaign, a court martial had been sitting at intervals,
as a little leisure could be spared, upon Lieutenant
Colonel Huffman, in command of Gano’s regiment.
General Morgan had given generous terms to those
who surrendered at Bacon’s Creek, and he was displeased
with Colonel Huffman’s apparent violation
of these terms, and five regimental commanders, Duke,
Breckinridge, Cluke, Hutchinson and Stoner, comprised
this court. Marching all day and some nights, with
an average of forty miles every twenty-four hours,
with an occasional diversion of a fight, it was rather
difficult for these judges to apportion exact justice to
the offending officer. An hour would be taken at night
and a little while during the rest of the day, but on this
particular morning a full session was held and Huffman
was acquitted. As the court martial was writing its
finding, couriers came scurrying from the rear with the
information that a large Federal force of infantry and
cavalry was close at hand and had opened fire. The
firing of the pickets and skirmishers was already audible.
Some of the troops had crossed the Rolling Fork,
but the others were on the same side with the Federals.
Cluke’s regiment under Major Bullock had been sent
to burn a railroad bridge, and to hold the enemy in
check, but the enemy did not seem willing to be checked
and they vigorously pressed his rear guard. If the
fording of the Rolling Fork had been practicable at
every point, it would be easy enough for those now
defending it to ride across, but when Cluke’s men got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span>
down to the stream it was found there to be impassable.
The fields and roads were full of bluecoats, and they
were coming where Morgan’s men were. They were
not advancing very eagerly, but all the same they were
coming. The skirmishers along the fences and in the
woods were delaying their progress as much as possible,
but formalities seemed to be waived, and the Federals
were pressing down upon the men on their side of the
stream in large force. The Federal artillery, well
managed, got the range of the ford where the Confederates
were crossing and was throwing shells with
accuracy and rapidity, which was splashing the water
along the line where the men in gray must pass. About
seven hundred men, including several companies of
Cluke’s regiment, were on the west side of Rolling Fork.
The Federal Army, composed of infantry and cavalry,
was closing in upon them. With an enemy in front
and the river behind them it looked especially gloomy
for the men under Cluke. This 8th Kentucky Cavalry
in camp, with a high type of soldierly pride, styled
themselves “Cluke’s War Dogs,” and it looked now as
if the “war dogs” were to get all the war that they could
possibly desire.</p>

<p>At this moment General Duke was struck on the
side of the head by a fragment of a shell and rendered
unconscious. A brave and agile soldier sprang behind
him and held him on his horse and carried him over the
stream. The skirmishers were plugging away at each
other at close range. One of the enemy’s batteries was
proving especially destructive, and Captain Virgil
Pendleton of the 8th Kentucky was ordered to charge
this battery. He killed the cannoneers or drove them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</span>
from their guns, and this silenced these destructive
agents for a quarter of an hour. This brave captain
was struck by an exploding shell from other guns of the
enemy and seriously and dangerously wounded. Ninety
days later he was killed while charging through the
streets of Mount Sterling.</p>

<p>Colonel W. C. P. Breckinridge assumed command
of the Confederates on the side with the Federals, and
with great skill and gallantry helped bring them out
of the perils that were thick around them.</p>

<p>Seconds were lengthened into minutes. The strain
was intense. It was a critical moment for the Confederates
not yet over the stream. Another assault
by the Federals meant capture or death or a plunge
into the deep, icy waters of Rolling Fork. At this
juncture the Federals suddenly retreated. No one has
ever been able to explain this let-up at this opportune
time for the advancing hosts, nor been able to guess
why the men in blue failed to attack and scatter their
foes when victory was so easy and only needed the
closing in to insure its certainty.</p>

<p>Hope appeared to be departing, and when it looked
darkest, some of Cluke’s men, by riding into the stream,
had found a possible but difficult ford. This had been
experimentally discovered. The emergencies forced
the men to ride out into the water. They had no
guides, and fortunately someone had found by testing
that there was a way of escape, and in the lull the rearguard
of the Confederates hurried across the stream.
The bulk of the casualties fell to Cluke’s regiment.
They had sustained their reputation as “war dogs.”
They were proud that the enterprise of their leaders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span>
their luck, and their courage had brought them safely
through.</p>

<p>General Morgan now turned detachments loose
upon the bridges upon the Lebanon Branch; some of
these were destroyed. This would prevent reinforcements
from rapidly reaching Lebanon. The stockade
at Boston and other small structures were burned.
On the night of the 30th the division camped at Bardstown,
and by three o’clock next day it bivouacked at
Springfield, nine miles from Lebanon. The fierce cold,
the long ride, the severe strain, physical and nervous,
demanded a brief halt. The leader realized that Morgan’s
men were human. He apprehended the seriousness
of the situation. Over at Lebanon, stretched far
away along the pike up towards Campbellsville and
Muldraugh’s Hill, the Federals were waiting to
contest the only good road by which he could reach
the Cumberland River. If he could get around Lebanon
to Campbellsville, he calculated that over the pike
from Campbellsville to Columbia he could make a
forced march that would enable him to outride the
Federals, who were taking a short cut from Glasgow
and surrounding towns, to head him off from Burksville
on the Cumberland River.</p>

<p>The Federals had been massing forces at Lebanon.
The glare of the camp fires could be seen from Springfield,
where Morgan was resting for the great spurt.
Enemies were there in such numbers that General
Morgan dared not attack the town. They were reported
eight thousand. Harlan, who had crossed
swords with him at Rolling Fork, was in his rear.
Colonels Halisy and Hoskins and their eight thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</span>
men were in his front. The night was intensely dark,
and the thermometer was below zero. The turnpike
between Springfield and Lebanon was full of Federal
pickets, backed up by infantry, that were double
Morgan’s numbers.</p>

<p>Early in the night Colonel A. R. Johnson of the
10th drove in the pickets on the Lebanon road and
attacked them with such fierceness that a cavalry
regiment which was stationed six miles from Lebanon,
on the Campbellsville road, was called in to help defend
the town. The withdrawal of this cavalry regiment
opened up a possible way of escape for Morgan without
a fight. At Springfield there were many friends and
sympathizers. They were honest and safe advisers.
Had Morgan’s men been fresh and his horses not
wearied, the situation would have been less perplexing
to the dauntless general. From every direction enemies
were fast approaching and, stirred deeply by the
criticisms of superiors, were closing in to destroy the
Confederate leader.</p>

<p>The hour had now come for Morgan again to
demonstrate the force of his genius and the extent of
his resources. He saw that the best way of escape was
the longest way; that he could not whip the eight
thousand Federals at Lebanon and he must manage
to get around them. He determined to make a detour
to the right of Lebanon, pass the Federal Army there,
then swing back on to the road which led from Lebanon
to Campbellsville and rush to the latter place with all
possible speed. He calculated that by outwitting the
enemy and by a forced march, he would reach Campbellsville
before his escape would be discovered and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</span>
before the Federals could get in his front to seriously
interfere with his going.</p>

<p>An appalling night’s experiences were now to face
the bold raider and his hardy followers. They were
without even hope of succor or support. Here Morgan
could rely only upon himself and those who were with
him to rid his path of the dangers, which, if he doubted
or hesitated, would be unsurmountable.</p>

<p>As the Federals at Lebanon did not come after him
he decided to remain at Springfield until eleven o’clock
at night. This would give time for sleep for the men
and opportunity to rest and feed the beasts. By the
hospitable firesides of sympathizers, the Confederates
warmed their benumbed limbs and the patient brutes
were allowed to feed and munch to their fill. To multiply
troubles, the temperature, already cold, had
become colder. Sharp, penetrating winds whistled
through the naked trees and whirled around the
corners of the houses, warning the wise to seek and keep
shelter. Wintry blasts notified the soldiers of what
might be expected if they dared defy their suggestion.
The mercury in the thermometer nestled several degrees
below zero and hid far down in the tube as if
afraid to expose itself to the cold. Morgan’s enemies
had not learned exactly where he was, but they knew
he was about and they knew that they were in his front.</p>

<p>General Boyle, commander of the Kentucky Department,
telegraphed Abraham Lincoln in Washington:
“Morgan is fleeing precipitately. He has paid
dearly for what he has done.” The wires were kept
busy by the Federals, prophesying what would happen
to the bold raiders. Superiors were assured that disaster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</span>
was bound to overtake Morgan within a few
hours. Fate had decreed that these prophecies were
not to be verified.</p>

<p>Everybody knew that really great work had been
cut out for the night. No order was required to tell
the men of this. The long rest at Springfield of eight
hours was a sure augury that a furious night march
was in store. The men prepared themselves as best
they could. At the hospitable little town of Springfield,
in cavalry parlance, “square meals” were available.
This meant that one could eat enough at a sitting
to tide over forty-eight to seventy-two hours without
hunger’s interference. A common sense of danger
filled the minds of all the soldiers at this resting place.
They knew that heavy work was expected, certainly a
night’s ride, facing the winds that cut to the marrow
and cold that struck into the joints, and maybe a
battle or attack in the darkness. They had wrapped
blankets about their bodies and covered their feet
with strips of cloth. The strain was too great for a few,
and here and there a man or so had succumbed to the
terrific pressure of the elements and had fallen out of
line; but in thirty-nine hundred men that such a small
number were unable to meet these difficulties was a
great tribute to both the physical and mental vigor
of these horsemen. They warmed themselves and satisfied
their appetites to the limit, and with the bravado
of true cavaliers, they bade care flee away and fears
begone as they mounted into their saddles. They
were not afraid to face any emergency, even all that
the dreadful night ahead had in store for man and
beast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</span></p>

<p>The aid of the best available guides was secured.
These bundled themselves up as if they were in Lapland.
At eleven o’clock on the night of the 30th,
General Morgan set out on his journey around his
enemies. He counted darkness as his best ally. It
was nine miles from Springfield to Lebanon and nine
miles from Lebanon to St. Mary’s, where he must pass
the Federal trocha, and then it was fifteen miles from
St. Mary’s to the point where General Morgan could
hope in safety to strike the turnpike from Lebanon to
Campbellsville. This meant a loss of fifteen miles,
with jaded horses and tired men. Before General Morgan
left Springfield he had a strong line of skirmishers
drive in the Federal pickets. These stacked rails for a
mile through the fields and then fired them. The
reflection of the flames on the sky caught the eyes of
the Federal pickets. The Union commanders came to
the conclusion that no men would dare march through
the wind and cold of such a night and Morgan was
where the flames were blazing, and that on the morrow,
to get by, he must engage them in combat. The mud
roads which the Confederates must follow to St. Mary’s
and to Newmarket were uneven, frozen, ragged. The
cold was so intense that it partially stupefied the
beasts. The men were compelled to dismount to keep
themselves from being frost bitten, and walk beside
their stumbling steeds. It seemed as if humanity could
not stand the dreadful punishment that nature was
inflicting upon these intrepid men. The game was too
fierce for a few, and these by sheer exhaustion fell by
the wayside. The horses in sympathy with their
masters hung their heads low. Icicles gathered on their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</span>
manes and breasts, covered their bridles and halters,
and dangled from their nostrils. Ice coated the beards
and moustaches of the men. Half the time they walked
by their steeds, stamping their feet, swinging their
hands and beating their bodies to drive away the stupor
which extreme cold imposes upon flesh and blood.
There was no loud word spoken. Commands, if given,
were uttered in soft tones, and all were directed to ride,
walk or march in absolute silence. These things added
much to the hardships of the night’s work. If they
could have jollied each other, or cheered or enlivened
the hours with badinage, it would have somewhat
relieved the oppressiveness of the continually lengthening
miles. The men obeyed the orders in patient submission
to the severe calls of the moment, and uncomplainingly
bore the burdens that patriotism exacted
of them in the dire emergency that war’s fortunes
had decreed they must endure. Man and beast seemed
to be well-nigh overwhelmed with the chilling air. It
was a long, long night, and one that no man who had
undergone its terrors would ever forget. Morgan’s
men had suffered many hardships and were yet to
know many more, but with one voice they declared
that this march around Lebanon to St. Mary’s and back
to the Campbellsville Pike was the most fearful experience
they had ever suffered, except, when ninety
days later, they rode the sixty miles from Saylersville
to Mount Sterling with Cluke, on March 20th, 1863.</p>

<p>At half past six o’clock day began to dawn.
The guides were bewildered or indifferent and had
lost their bearings. When the light enabled them to
take in the surroundings, it came out that the command<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</span>
had only made something like two miles an hour,
and instead of being well on the road towards Campbellsville,
they were only two and a half miles from
Lebanon. The Federals in camp had laid upon their
arms all night. They could sleep and cover up their
heads and rest with some degree of comfort in their
tents, but they were not astir very early, and they had
no accurate knowledge whither Morgan had gone. It
was a glad moment when light lifted the burdens from
the weary marchers. The sun riding from the east
through the clouds assured these nervy horsemen that
the terrors of darkness no longer overshadowed them.
Once again on the macadam highway, the horses
seemed glad and quickened their pace. Increasing
speed, with its accelerated motion, brought warmth
to their bodies and cheer to their masters’ hearts. At
nightfall the command was safe at Campbellsville.
They pondered over the terribleness of the past night’s
experiences, but the enemy was behind, and this repaid
them for the sufferings and agony they had endured.</p>

<p>On the march up the long hill where the turnpike,
by constant but easy and tortuous gradients, reaches
the tablelands around Campbellsville, the county seat
of Taylor County, occurred one of the real tragedies
of the war. Colonel Dennis J. Halisy commanded the
6th Kentucky Federal Cavalry. He had charge of the
advance in pursuit of Morgan. He was a bred fighter,
young, ambitious, game to the core, and as adventurous
as he was game. Halisy was following Morgan’s rear
guard with the Federal horsemen, picking up the
stragglers, if any could be found, and pushing the
Confederates as strongly as prudence would allow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span>
Captain Alex. Treble and Lieutenant George B.
Eastin were both officers of the 2d Kentucky Confederate
Cavalry. These lagged behind the rear guard in
search of adventure, anxious to show that nobody
retreating was afraid, and not unwilling for a fight,
if favorable opportunities came their way.</p>

<p>The top of Muldraugh’s Hill, which overlooked the
plain below, where Lebanon, St. Mary’s and Springfield
had been passed, was reached a brief while after midday.
Treble and Eastin were superbly mounted.
Both were over six feet tall, wiry, vigorous men, whose
nerves and muscles had been hardened by the exposure
and training of severest military experiences. Coming
along an open stretch, a thousand feet away, these two
young soldiers observed Colonel Halisy and three
officers quite far advanced ahead of the Federal column.
They were both proud, born brave and dauntless, and
they resented the idea that two Kentucky Confederate
cavalrymen would run away from a fight with four
Federals. Placing themselves behind a sudden turn
in the road, they waited for the pursuers to appear.
Both skilled revolver shots, they were confident that
by a sudden onslaught they would kill two of those
following and then grapple with the remaining couple
and win out. If they had reasoned they would have,
hesitated, but in that period of the war, the courage
and pride amongst the Kentucky boys who went
south did not consume time reasoning nor making
many figures in calculating the hazards and dangers of
rencontres, and so they resolved to stake their lives,
or at least their liberties, on the issue with these foes,
who appeared equally indifferent to peril.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span></p>
<p>Curiously, as Halisy and his lieutenant came close
upon Treble and Eastin, their two companions fell
back to the head of the column and thus left the battle
two and two.</p>

<p>Swinging out into the road as Colonel Halisy and
his aide approached, the two officers in gray fired at
their opponents. They were greatly surprised and
disgusted that neither shot took effect. Four men,
too brave and too intrepid to run away from a foe,
grappled on their horses. They pulled each other from
their mounts and fell, side by side, to the ground.
Treble seized his foe and pushed his head into a pool
or stream of water, from whence, half drowned, he
asked quarter. Eastin had Halisy underneath him,
and with his pistol at his head, forced him to surrender.
The Federal colonel yielded but still held his pistol
in his hand. As he arose from the earth, quickly cocking
his revolver, he fired at his captor, but the bullet
only grazed the cheek of the Confederate, who in turn
instantly fired his weapon and killed Halisy. The
conflict, the struggles, the shots, attracted the attention
of the advancing Federals, who rushed to the rescue
of their leader and comrade. Hastily taking the
colonel’s sword and the pistols of the two men, Treble
and Eastin galloped off to join the Confederate rear
guard, which was now nearly out of sight. The Federals
claimed that Colonel Halisy had been shot without
provocation after he surrendered, but subsequent
investigation showed that such a charge was totally
unfounded and that Eastin was fully justified in the
course he pursued. Just six months later, Captain
Treble, having been transferred to Chenault’s regiment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span>
was killed at Green River Stockade on July 4th, 1863,
on the road between Campbellsville and Columbia,
twenty-two miles from the scene of this conflict, as
Morgan was commencing the Ohio Raid. In the assault
on the Federal fortification Colonel Chenault was
killed, and Major James B. McCreary, now governor
of Kentucky, assumed command of the regiment. He
rode down the line to notify Captain Treble that he
was to act as lieutenant colonel, and in case he—McCreary—fell,
to take charge of the regiment. As Treble
rose from the line and waved his hand to salute his
superior, to let him know the order was understood,
he was struck by a shot from a Federal sharpshooter
and fell dead at McCreary’s feet. Strangely enough,
when Major Brent of the 5th Regiment, sent by General
Morgan to get information as to how things were going,
rode forward, as he lifted his hand to salute Colonel
McCreary, he was shot through the brain and fell dead
at his side.</p>

<p>Eastin, after a brilliant and highly adventurous war
experience, became a learned and distinguished lawyer
in Louisville, a member of the Kentucky Court of
Appeals, and after a long and splendid career, died in
Louisville in 1896. He was beloved and honored wherever
he was known. He was courteous, gentle, brave
and loyal in all phases of life and was universally
mourned when he died at the early age of fifty-four.</p>

<p>The Federals, fortunately, had laid by large supplies
of commissary stores at Campbellsville, and in these
captured goods there was enough to satisfy, clothe
and feed man and beast. Strong pickets were ordered
out on every road so that there could be no possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</span>
surprise. The wear and tear of the day previous had
been so dreadful that General Morgan resolved to give
his horses and men time to recuperate. True, it was a
risk, but the voice of humanity as well as necessity
appealed for a brief respite to those men who so uncomplainingly
had borne up under a physical strain
that, in all the great war, where cavalry had done what
no other cavalry ever did, had rarely been equalled and
never surpassed. It was twenty-two miles to Columbia.
The artillery had good roads and fresh horses, and they
could keep any pace the cavalry might set. Caution
spoke of a night march, but mercy protested, and mercy
prevailed, and for eight hours riders and beasts slept
as only the weary and cold could sleep. The day had
not broken when the call of the bugles bid the sleepers
rise and prepare for another struggle against nature
and its adverse forces. There were enemies who were
bravely and vigorously marching to thwart their escape
from the state, and hem them in on their homeward
ride.</p>

<p>When the command ascended a hill on the Columbia
Road, heavy cannonading was heard. It was the
sounds which were coming from the far-off battlefield
of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, ninety miles away, and
it fell like a pall upon the minds and hearts of these
men far up in the Kentucky mountains. These dull,
rumbling tones proclaimed that Bragg and Rosecrans
on Stone River were grappling with each other in
gigantic conflict.</p>

<p>When at three p. m. the division rode into Columbia,
the marchers breathed more freely, as the first danger
post was passed. Only a couple of hours was given for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span>
rest and food. The Cumberland River, the real line of
safety, was thirty miles away. General Morgan, not
sure that his foes might not yet intercept him, bade the
men get ready for another all night ride. It was still
bitter cold, the road to be traveled was rough and
broken, but the voice of safety was whispering that
over the Cumberland alone could absolute security
be found. The leader loved his men. He realized
how loyal, brave and patient they had been in the ten
days since they had ridden out of Alexandria. It was
a hard order to issue, but everything was at stake;
he dare not, with all his love for his brave riders,
compromise his duty to the Cause he and they loved
so well, and for which they were placing their lives in
constant jeopardy.</p>

<p>At night, in the darkness and bitter cold, the division
rode into Burksville on the Cumberland River.
No enemy appeared. The spirits of the men returned.
Even the beasts seemed to catch the hopefulness of
the hour, and by the night of the 2d of January the
Cumberland River was crossed. The raid was ended.
The expedition had been successful and the command
was safe. The pursuit was not resumed, and so,
leisurely marching down through Livingstone, they
reached Smithville, Tennessee, on the morning of
January 5th. Here they rested for several days to
allow the men and horses to build up and to forget the
dreadful experiences of the terrific march. They had
been absent seventeen days. They had ridden five
hundred miles, captured eighteen hundred and seventy-seven
prisoners and stores indescribable, and of tremendous
value. Twenty-six had been killed and sixty-four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span>
were wounded and missing. A few had fallen out
of the line of march around Lebanon and been captured,
but less than two and a half in every hundred were
lacking when, on the south bank of the Cumberland,
an inventory was taken and a roll call made. These
thirty-nine hundred horsemen had been roughly
handled and battered both by their foes and by the
fierce elements, but they had borne it all with heroic
fortitude and were not only ready but anxious at the
earliest moment to try another issue with the enemies
of their country.</p>

FORREST’S PURSUIT AND CAPTURE OF<br>
STREIGHT, APRIL 28-MAY 3, 1863</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The Battle of Murfreesboro closed on January 2d,
1863. The Army of the Cumberland under
Rosecrans and the Army of the Tennessee under
Bragg made no important moves or advances until
late in the spring. Both armies had suffered a tremendous
shock and great decimation, and it took them
some time to recover from the effects of that frightful
conflict.</p>

<p>Among the most enterprising Federal officers in the
Army of the Cumberland was Colonel Abel D. Streight.
Born in Wheeling, New York, in 1829, he was at this
time just thirty-four years of age. He had recruited
the 51st Regiment of Indiana Infantry, and his regiment
had been a part of the Army of the Cumberland
for some months. The story of success of the Confederate
raids of Wheeler and Forrest and Morgan and
Stuart had kindled the desire among some of the
Federals to carry out similar operations.</p>

<p>During the time that Rosecrans and Bragg were
waiting to get ready for another great battle, Streight
conceived the brilliant plan of moving a cavalry brigade
up the Tennessee River by boats to a point near Tuscumbia,
Alabama, and there disembarking, march a
little south of east to Rome, Georgia, a distance of a
hundred and sixty miles. Although an infantryman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span>
he had pondered the marvelous raids of the western
cavalry and he longed to imitate the example of the
horsemen. He calculated that along the route of his
march, both coming and going, he could play havoc, and
destroy at will all manufactories and other property
which could be, directly or indirectly, used for the
maintenance of the war. It required a man of great
genius and transcendent courage at that period of the
war, who had no more experience than Streight, to
organize and carry out such a scheme. He argued if
Forrest in Mississippi, Wheeler in Tennessee, Alabama
and Georgia, and Morgan in Tennessee and Kentucky,
could successfully win out in their raids, he also might
hope for equally good fortune. It was as bold if not a
bolder feat than any Confederate cavalryman up to
this time had undertaken. Streight deserved in this
expedition more than fate accorded him. There had
been some Federal companies recruited in the northern
part of Alabama. Quite a portion of the people in that
part of the state were disloyal to the Confederate cause.
Frequent invasions of the Federals had developed this
spirit of resistance to the authorities of the Confederacy
and also promoted enlistments.</p>

<p>Streight had come in contact with these companies
of cavalry which had been recruited while refugeeing
from Alabama. They would be thoroughly familiar
with the route Streight intended to travel. Without
the assistance of guides like these, such an expedition
would be impossible. He had heard of the disloyalty
of these people, and he was sure they would be glad to
welcome his coming into their midst, and would in
considerable numbers flock to his standard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</span></p>

<p>In a little while, Colonel Streight, who in sleep or
waking pondered his plans, had so far worked out his
project that he put it on paper and submitted it to his
superior officers. They were delighted with the possibility
of such an expedition, capable of doing such tremendous
damage to the Confederacy, and his superiors
concluded if Streight was willing to risk his life and his
reputation, the Federal government could afford to
risk a couple of thousand troops, as many mules and a
cannon or two. His associates encouraged him in every
way possible, commended and applauded him, and told
him the government was ready to place at his disposal
all the resources necessary to conduct such a campaign.</p>

<p>He was regarded by his superiors as the most daring
and enterprising man of the hour, and not a word of
caution was sounded in his ears. No echo of possible
failure, or faintest warning escaped the lips of those
with whom he counseled. If they questioned, naught
of their doubts came to him.</p>

<p>In order that Streight’s command might start fresh
and be prepared to make a great spurt, his brigade was
organized at Nashville and it was proposed to transport
it from there on eight or ten large steamers, down the
Cumberland River to the Ohio, thence to the mouth
of the Tennessee River and up the Tennessee for several
hundred miles to Eastport, Mississippi, and from this
point to enter upon the real work of the expedition.
The fact was emphasized that under this system of
transportation, men and horses would start on the
campaign absolutely fresh and ready for a headlong
rush of ten days. It was calculated that possibly
even more time could be consumed in the daring work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</span>
which had been assigned for this adventurous command.
In these days, on both sides men were prepared to take
boundless risks. Their hopes and not their fears were
their guides. It was decided that Streight might
choose his own troops. He selected his own, the 51st
Indiana Regiment. He felt that it was reliable. To
this he added the 73d Indiana, under Colonel Gilbert
Hathaway, hardly less brave and resourceful than
Streight, the 3d Ohio and the 80th Illinois, and two
companies of Alabama cavalry, with a small battery.
They made up a force of two thousand men. Nobody
ever seemed to think it was necessary to advise with
cavalry officers. Streight wanted to make the raid and
he felt that he could accomplish what he had proposed
and he consulted only with infantrymen. These officers,
who had had no cavalry experience, decided that mules
would be more reliable than horses, that they could
do better service in the mountainous country through
which the expedition would pass, in that they could live
on less and were hardier. When they came to this
conclusion, they made their great mistake. It was
strange that men with the experience and judgment
of the Federal officers who were advising Colonel
Streight would permit him to start out with untrained
animals. At Nashville, they gave him a few hundred
mules, some two years old, many unbroken, and a
number of them in the throes of distemper. As the
expedition was to be one of spoliation, the impressment
of horses was to be an essential for success. The troops
and such mules as could be spared were placed on
steamers and brought down the Cumberland River,
to a landing called Palmyra, and there they marched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span>
through to Fort Henry on the Tennessee River. This
march ought to have been done in a few hours, but it
required four days. Streight’s men were sent out in
every direction in squads and singly to scour the whole
country and impress every mule that could be found.
They spared nothing that could walk or which could be
saddled, and they took everything of the horse or mule
kind that was attainable in the territory through which
they forayed. With all this diligence and impressment
they were still short of mounts. They had saddles and
bridles, but they had no animals on which their equipment
could be placed. After re-embarking at Fort
Henry, with a convoy of a brigade of marines, and several
gunboats, Streight reached East Port, Mississippi,
where he put his men ashore and dismissed the boats.</p>

<p>General Granville M. Dodge, in command of the
Federals in that locality, had been directed to give
Streight every possible assistance. Dodge was twelve
miles away from where Streight landed, but the leader
of the expedition immediately rode over to where Dodge
was. The Federals numbered some seven thousand or
eight thousand men. Colonel P. D. Roddy, with a
small brigade of Confederate cavalry, intercepted the
advance of Dodge’s troops. It was the plan that
Dodge should make a feint for a few miles into Alabama.
This would protect Streight until he got started on his
march, and would also terrorize the Confederates by
threats of an invasion by a larger force.</p>

<p>At Eastport, the troubles of Colonel Streight began.
Mules when broken are patient workers, but they are
very uncertain performers, and when thirteen hundred
had been corraled they all set up a loud braying. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</span>
a while this puzzled and disturbed the Confederates,
but in those days Confederate cavalrymen were very
quick-witted and they took in the situation and stole
across the picket lines covering Streight’s men and
mules, crawling in amongst them, and began hooting and
yelling and firing their pistols and guns. This was a
new experience for these long-eared military appliances;
they immediately stampeded, and at daybreak Streight
found four hundred of his best mules gone. This was
precious time wasted. He spent thirty-six hours in
recovering his lost property, but more than half of the
mules never came back. They had been picked up by
Roddy’s scouts, who thanked God for this addition to
their mounts.</p>

<p>Roddy and Colonel William A. Johnson, with three
small Alabama regiments, were plugging away at
Dodge’s advance, and so thorough were their efforts
that it took practically four days to reach Tuscumbia.
Here Streight brought up his own men and mules, and
Dodge gave him six hundred mules and some horses,
together with ten thousand rations of bread and six
wagons. The Federal leader realized the tremendous
task that he had undertaken. He looked over all those
who were to go with him, and saw to it that the faint-hearted
and the physically ailing dropped out of his
column.</p>

<p>Colonel Streight, with all his courage, was afraid
of one man. That man was General Nathan Bedford
Forrest. Dodge told Streight that Forrest had crossed
the Tennessee River, and Streight knew well that if
this was so, it meant trouble. The most precious hours
of Streight’s life were the 24th, 25th and 26th of April.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</span>
The delays made on those days were his undoing.
The Confederates had not yet apprehended the Federal
purposes. They knew where Dodge was, and they
brought some cavalry down to impede his march, but
they did not know that Streight was behind Dodge
and that in a few hours, like a meteor, he was to be
hurled down into their territory under orders to make a
raid of more than one hundred and fifty miles into the
very heart of the Confederacy, to destroy there what
no money could replace, and which was absolutely
vital to the maintenance of the Confederate armies
at the front.</p>

<p>It was passing strange that the Federal government,
with men wise in so many military ways, and so many
West Point men—like Sherman, Halleck and Grant—would
permit Streight’s enthusiasm to induce authority
to enter upon such an expedition without the most
complete preparation. Under the most favorable
conditions, the odds were at least even, and the Federal
soldiers were certainly entitled, in view of the risk they
assumed, to the very best their government could give.
Instead, Streight got the worst. He started short of
horses and mules, and, although brave, intrepid and
ambitious, he could not make a raid without reasonably
good mounts. Streight was anxious to go. He felt
that if he succeeded, he would become renowned, and
forge at once to the front as the greatest of Federal
cavalry leaders.</p>

<p>Still lacking animals, it was decided that Streight
should move out in front of Dodge’s forces and pounce
upon the unsuspecting planters and farmers in contiguous
territory. Several hundred of his men were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</span>
still unmounted. Russellville was the county seat of
Franklin County, Alabama—eighteen miles south of
Tuscumbia. By swinging down these eighteen miles,
it would permit the scouts from his command to penetrate
ten miles farther, and impressment was driven
to the extremest limits. Some animals escaped, but
many were taken. Turning directly east, Streight
moved up to Moulton—twenty miles distant. This
gave him still more territory for impressment and confiscation,
so that when he reached Moulton he had only
a few men who had not some sort of a beast to ride.
Upon the day following, Streight left Moulton, and
on the morning of the 29th of April, Forrest was just
sixteen miles away at Courtland. By this time, Forrest
had thoroughly divined Streight’s plan. He hurried in
behind him and resolved to make escape impossible.
Streight had left Moulton in the night, and by the time
Forrest reached Moulton his trail was a little cold.
Forrest told his soldiers that whatever else got wet,
the cartridges were to be kept dry. As he rode out of
Courtland, a cold, drizzling rain set in, but there was
nothing could dampen the ardor and enthusiasm of the
pursuers. They were man-hunting, and that always
makes the drive furious. With hard riding, Streight
had reached Sand Mountain. He had bravely struggled
to get on, but bad roads, bad weather, inferior mounts,
and the wagons and artillery held him up. He was not
sure that Forrest was behind. He earnestly hoped he
was not. Streight rested all night, while Forrest was
riding most of the night. He had only twelve hundred
men and Streight sixteen hundred. There was never
a time when Forrest needed more faith in his men.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</span>
He had that faith, and he knew that if he could put his
followers to the test, they would be found always
dependable. Nobody thought about leadership or
suggested anything to Forrest. The men who rode
with him believed that he knew everything, and all
they asked was to be allowed to follow where he led.
Forrest, rushing his men all the night of the 29th and
the morning of the 30th, came close upon Streight’s
command without their knowledge. Both men had
started just at the dawn of day, and both were
dreadfully in earnest. Streight’s men were already
marching up the tortuous road to the crest of Sand
Mountain. As the head of the column reached the
summit, the bursting of a shell at the bottom and the
driving in of the pickets told Streight that the man he
feared was at his heels and had already begun to harass
and harry. No sooner had the sound of the guns been
heard than Streight, with the instincts of a soldier
and the courage of a warrior, rushed back to the rear.
He wanted to be where the danger was greatest and the
conflict keenest. General Dodge had promised Streight
to hold Forrest in check; and, if he got away, to pursue
and nag him. He failed to keep his pledge.</p>

<p>In the beginning, Forrest underestimated both the
courage and resources of his antagonists. Up to this
period in his career, he had never struck anything
that was so game and so wary as this intrepid brigade
of Streight’s. He had not then realized that they
were dauntless soldiers—led by a man as brave as
the bravest. His first idea that they would become
a lot of fugitives who had neither skill nor courage was
soon dissipated. Captain William Forrest, brother of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</span>
General Nathan Bedford Forrest, was in command of
the advance guards and scouts. With a valor born of
unlimited courage, he rushed up to the fleeing Federals,
now climbing the sides of the mountain. He manifested
neither fear nor discretion. He had absorbed
his brother’s genius for quick and fierce assault. In a
little while he ran into an ambuscade skillfully designed
by Streight, who had left Colonel Sheets of the 51st
Indiana in the rear. A minie ball broke Captain
Forrest’s hip, and he fell in the midst of his enemies.
Forrest had been accustomed to reckless use of his
artillery. It was not often that his enemies disturbed
him, but on this occasion he lost two of his pieces,
and, right or wrong, he felt that the young lieutenant
in charge of these pieces had not exactly measured up
to his standard of determination. He requested later
that this young officer be assigned to some other command.
This brought about an altercation; the young
officer attacked Forrest and shot him—as was supposed
to be—mortally. Forrest, ferociously pursuing his
antagonist, killed him. In death they were reconciled:
the patriotic young officer expressing joy that his shot
had failed of its purpose, that Forrest was to live and
he to die.</p>

<p>Fighting, fleeing, feinting, ambuscading, hammering
was now the order of the day. With his military
experience and from fragmentary statements of his
captives, Forrest knew that Rome was the destination
of Streight. He understood what its destruction would
mean to his people and to his country, and he resolved
first, that Streight should never reach Rome, and second
that he should never escape from the Confederate lines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</span>
into which he had so boldly and fearlessly moved.
At and about Rome, the Confederacy had unlimited
treasures—there were foundries and manufactories of
arms and munitions of war.</p>

<p>To his famous and gallant brother, Forrest gave
only one command. He assumed that he and his forty
scouts would need no sleep—at least they could have
no rest—and so he told his brother to keep right on
down the road and get up close to see what the enemy
was doing. Streight made the mistake of ever taking
any wagons at all. Climbing these narrow mountain
roads with these impediments, his speed was greatly
hindered. He had not gotten two miles from the top
of Sand Mountain when he saw he must fight. Forrest’s
order to “shoot at everything blue and keep up
the scare” was driving his men with the courage of
demons to attack every blue coat, wherever it was
found. He had only one thousand men. He advanced
them fearlessly and recklessly. Streight’s men fought
vigorously and viciously. For a few moments they
threw a considerable portion of Forrest’s forces into
disorder, and with a gallant and splendid charge,
scattered the advance guard of the Confederates.
When Forrest was told that his guns were lost, he was
beside himself with rage. He had too few men to use
horse holders. He directed his men to tie their horses
in the forest, and then ordered every soldier to the
front. The effect of the loss of his guns upon his men
he felt might destroy their morale, and he assembled
his entire force and led them in a charge on the Federal
rear. While Forrest was making these preparations
to retake his guns, Streight’s men were all ready to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</span>remount their mules and ride in haste along the Blountsville
Road. Streight had heard much of Forrest, and
he was pleased with this repulse and the capture of
Forrest’s guns. He congratulated himself that he
could make a good showing even if he faced Forrest’s
veterans.</p>

</figure>

<p>Something like fifty of Streight’s men had been
killed or wounded, and he left his own lieutenant,
Colonel James W. Sheets of the 51st Indiana, mortally
wounded on the field. There was no time for burial
services, regrets, tears or ceremonies. While Sheets
was mortally wounded, Forrest’s brother was desperately
wounded. The Indiana colonel was left in
the hands of his captors, and his lifeless body was
consigned to a coffinless tomb. He died as brave
men wish to die—at the front, with his face to his foes.</p>

<p>Forrest had sent two of his regiments by gaps
parallel with Day’s Gap, to attempt to head off the
Federals. In this, they failed because of the long detours
they were compelled to make. Forrest now detached
a portion of his command to ride parallel with
Streight and west of him, and to be sure that he would
not be permitted to retrace his steps toward Dodge’s
protecting forces at Tuscumbia. It was well into the
day before Forrest and his escort and his two regiments
were able to overtake Streight again. He was once
more repulsed. They fought and battled with unstinted
fury until ten o’clock at night, and then Streight
silently stole away. The Federals held their ground
with unflinching courage and far into the night, when
their only guide was the flash of their guns. Forrest
had one horse killed and two others wounded under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</span>
him in this encounter. A flank movement impressed
upon Streight the danger of his position, and he hurried
away, leaving his dead and wounded in possession of
his foes, and Forrest retook his guns. They had been
dismounted, spiked and the carriages destroyed; but
he had them, and, though useless, he had regained
them from his foes.</p>

<p>Streight had a great helper with him, a man who
had not so much experience, but he had as much
courage. This was Colonel Gilbert Hathaway, of
LaPorte, Indiana. In August, 1862, he had recruited
a regiment which was mustered in at South Bend. He
and his command had been at Stone River, and there
paid very heavy toll. His soldiers were well drilled
and seasoned. Colonel Sheets had gone down at the
front with the 51st, and since he fell, Streight laid
heaviest burden upon Colonel Hathaway. Streight
had now behind him a man who knew neither faintness
nor fear, and when he rode away, Forrest and his men
rode savagely behind him. Two or three hours had
elapsed, when the impact in the rear was so fierce that
Streight decided to use another ambuscade to stop,
if possible, until daylight, the impetuosity of the
pursuers.</p>

<p>With the obscurity of the night, Streight had used
great skill and genius. Forrest called for volunteers to
ride into the Federal lines and develop their fire, so
that he might fix the position of his foe. Lots of men
volunteered, but three were selected. They rode in
knowingly to the death trap that had been arranged
with such care and cunning. All three came out of a
storm of shot and shell untouched. No sooner had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</span>
scouts informed General Forrest of the position of the
enemy, than he ordered forward a piece of artillery,
filled almost to the mouth with canister. Noiselessly,
the artillery was pushed up to the Federal position, and
then by the moonlight, the inclination of the gun was
fixed so as to reach where Forrest had been told the
Federals were. It was three o’clock in the morning,
an hour that tries men’s nerves. A second piece of
artillery was brought into requisition. This disturbed
Streight and his men, and they were called in and
hurried on to Blountsville. From Day’s Gap to
Blountsville was forty-three miles. It had been a march
of fighting and ambuscading, marked on both sides
with noblest courage. At Blountsville, there was yet
hope for Streight. If he drove due north, he was only
thirty miles away from Guntersville, on the Tennessee
River. There he might be safe; but Streight had
started out to go to Rome, and to Rome he resolved
to go at all hazards. Forrest felt that the troops he had
despatched from Sand Mountain to head Streight off
would meet him, if he veered from the line to Rome.
Streight, true to his plans and promises, kept on the
road he had mapped out to follow. Forrest had now
been riding forty out of forty-eight hours, and for more
than a third of the time he had been fighting. Seeing
that Streight had now resolved to keep upon the direct
course toward Rome, Forrest did the wisest thing that
any cavalry officer could do. He concluded to rest
his animals, and give his men two hours’ sleep. The
horses were unsaddled and fed the last shelled corn
that they had packed on their weary backs from
Courtland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</span></p>

<p>Streight gave his men no rest, and at ten o’clock,
upon the morning of the first of May, he rode into
Blountsville. Strange scenes were enacted in that
little town on that May Day. People from the surrounding
country had come into the village to enjoy
the festivities of such a holiday. They had driven or
ridden their best horses and mules. There was food
enough in town for Streight’s men to eat and enough
fresh animals to assure every man in blue a mount. The
pleasures of the picnic were rudely shattered; robbed
by hungry Federals of baskets or lunches, they scattered
like bird coveys, and from the homes of friends,
hidden behind fences, or peering from the bushes with
grief, rage and indignation, they witnessed their family
steeds unhitched or unsaddled, harnessed with cavalry
equipments, forced into the Federal column, and galloped
away with the hated soldiers on their back.
Girls, with tears raining down their cheeks, saw their
pet saddle horses fade into the dim distance. The
older men groaned in spirit, and the young men writhed
in anguish to realize that the mounts which had long
been their chiefest pride were thus ruthlessly taken from
their possession. This first of May was the dreariest
and saddest that ever came into the lives of Blountsville
folk.</p>

<p>Refreshed with food and a momentary rest, the
Federal leader realized that all impedimenta must be
thrown away; that to escape Forrest, he must march
with quicker gait and move with longer strides. Rations
and ammunition were counted out to the men.
A portion of the contents of the wagons were packed
upon mules. He parked his wagons and set them afire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</span>
They had hardly begun to burn when the 4th Tennessee
Regiment, under Starnes, charged into the village and
drove out Streight’s rear guard. Streight had rested
two hours, but he had rested the wrong two hours.
Forrest’s men were fresh from their two hours’ sleep.
Streight’s rear guard was constantly and vigorously
pursued and attacked. Federals concealed in the bushes
fired into the advancing column. Here and there a man
fell wounded, maybe dead, and dying or disabled horses
were the markers that were revealing to the pursued
and the pursuers the savageness of war, but none of
these stayed the men who were harrying the Federal
rear guard.</p>

<p>Blountsville was ten miles from the Black Warrior
River. The road had become wider and smoother,
but Forrest’s pursuit became still more aggressive.
Protecting the crossing by heavy lines of skirmishers
on each side of the river and pointing his two howitzers
westwardly, a spirited resistance was made by Streight,
but Forrest’s men, seemingly never tiring, charging
again and again, finally broke the line. It was five
o’clock in the afternoon of May 1st when the last
Federal forded the Black Warrior River. Men sleeping
on their horses, here and there dropping from their
steeds by either fatigue or sleep, reminded General
Forrest that he had about reached the limit of human
endurance, that there were some things even his
trained riders could not do. Reserving one hundred
men for pursuit, he now permitted his soldiers to go
into camp for three hours. Scant forage furnished
his horses a small ration, but his men preferred sleep
to food, and they laid down to profoundest slumber.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</span>
This gave Streight surcease from battle until nine
o’clock next morning, but unwisely he drove his men
every moment of the night. He reached Black Creek,
four miles from Gadsden, but he reached it with his men
fearfully worn and depressed. Forrest, true to his
instincts and his knowledge of the powers of human
resistance, let every man he could spare from picket
duty enjoy a brief undisturbed repose. He calculated
that he could release some from aggressive assault and
sent one of his regiments to the rear and told them to
sleep. Streight had marched during all the night.
Forrest had rested three hours, and he was thereby
enabled to begin pursuit with increased vigor. Riding
at the head of his men, he spurred them on to supremest
effort, to reach Black Creek and save the bridge. He
hoped to push Streight so hard that he would not find
time to wreck or burn the structure spanning that
stream.</p>

<p>At Blount’s Farm, ten miles from Gadsden, one of
the dismal tragedies of the expedition was enacted.
On the first day of May, at 4 p. m., Colonel Streight
reached Blount’s Plantation. There were only fifteen
miles between him and Gadsden. This plantation
furnished abundant forage for his horses. While the
horses fed, the soldiers ate; a portion standing attentive
in line ready to obstruct the advance of the Confederates.
This rear guard was again vigorously
attacked by Forrest. In resisting this advance, Colonel
Gilbert Hathaway was mortally wounded. Forrest
had become wary of ambuscades, and was so cautiously
watching for them that Streight declined to waste his
time in further preparing them. The rear guard was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</span>
under the direction of Hathaway. This soldier Streight
was now cherishing as his best helper. This Federal
hero, leading his men in a charge, fell with his face to
the foe, crying out, “If we die, let us die at the front,”
and there he went down, covered with the glory and
honor which fame always accords to the brave. There
was only time for comrades to request a decent burial
for the brave Indiana colonel who had died so far away
from home, and had been cut down in the full pride
of his splendid career. These officers had known different
experiences from the Confederates. They had been
accustomed, when men of rank were killed, to handsome
coffins and the consoling ornaments and trappings
which robbed death on the battlefield of some of its terrors.
The owner of the plantation was asked to provide
a metallic case for the remains of the dead soldier. He
mournfully said, “There are no metallic cases in this
country.” “Then give him a plain pine coffin,” pleaded
the Federal officer, now exposed to and endangered by
the fire of the advancing Confederates. “We have no
coffins,” replied the man, sadly shaking his head.
“Then take some planks and make a box and bury him
and mark his grave.” “You have burned all my
planks,” replied the man, “and I have nothing with
which to make even a box.” “Then,” he pleaded once
again, with the bullets whistling around his head and
with the Confederates immediately in sight, “wrap
his body in an oil cloth and bury him, for God’s sake,
where he may be found,”—and this the magnanimous
planter agreed to do. He faithfully kept his pledge,
and in the Alabama garden he gave sepulture to the
gallant soldier. The Federal officer, with his enemies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</span>
at his heels, and with the Confederate bullets buzzing
about his person, waved the dust of his comrade a
last sad adieu, and putting spurs to his horse galloped
away and left the dead hero with his enemies to make
and guard his tomb.</p>

<p>Far down in Walton County in Southwestern
Georgia, a plain, hard-working farmer of Scotch-Irish
descent, known among his neighbors as Macajah Sansom,
lived at a little town called Social Circle. He
heard of richer land in Alabama bottoms and decided
to migrate. The youngest child in the family was
Emma Sansom, born in 1847.</p>

<p>The change was not propitious for the father, and
in 1859, seven years after his change of home, he died,
leaving a son and two daughters to the care of his widow.
In 1861, the lad, Rufus, the oldest of the family, heard
the call of his country and went away as a member of
the 19th Alabama Infantry, to defend its rights. The
little farm was left to the oversight of the mother and
her two daughters. War’s ravages had not reached
where they lived. The son and protector had been
away twenty months, and all this desolate family knew
of war was what Rufus had written of his campaigning
and the narratives brought back by an occasional
furloughed neighbor, or some who in battle had lost a
leg or an arm, and returned disabled, bearing in their
persons memorials of how terrible was real war.</p>

<p>The father had settled on Black Creek, four miles
west of Gadsden, on the highway from Blountsville to
Gadsden. On one side of his farm was an uncovered
wooden bridge, plain and unsightly, but saved the passers-by
from fording the deep, sluggish stream that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</span>
essayed to halt man and beast on their travels across
this new and thinly settled country. The dead father
had built a small doubled, one-storied frame house from
lumber sawed out of the pine trees that grew in luxuriance
on the hills, a short distance back from the
Creek. These two girls and their mother had but little
of this world’s goods. Some cows, chickens, a few pigs
and a horse constituted all their possessions. They
loved their country, and they gloried in the courage of
the young man who was so faithfully and bravely
fighting at the front. Joseph Wheeler was the first
colonel of the 19th. This regiment had been at Mobile
and later at Shiloh, where two hundred and nineteen
of its members had been killed and wounded. It had
marched with Bragg into Kentucky and down through
Mississippi, and later in the valley of Stone River, at
the Battle of Murfreesboro, where one hundred and
fifty-one of its members were killed or received wounds.
In his simple, guileless, homely way, he had written
the awful experiences through which he and the neighbor
boys had passed, and the mother and sisters were
proud of him and loved him for the dangers through
which he had come, and what he had done made them
zealous for the cause for which they had sent him away
to endure and dare so much. Each mail day—for
mails did not come often into this isolated territory—they
watched and waited for the letter to tell what the
brother was doing at the far-off front. A fifth of the
neighbors and friends who made up the Gadsden
company were filling soldier’s graves in Tennessee,
Kentucky, Mississippi and Alabama, and these defenseless
women were afraid to open the letters that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</span>
were post-marked from the army lest there should
come tidings of the death of the one they so dearly
loved.</p>

<p>By the afternoon of May 2d, the pressure of Streight
and his men by Forrest was at its fiercest tension.
Guided by his two companies of Alabama refugee
horsemen, Streight had been told if he could only
cross Black Creek and burn the bridge, that he might
hope for a few hours’ respite, and if he could not feed
his weary men and wearier beasts, he could at least
let them sleep enough to restore a part of their wasted
energy, and from a few hours’ repose get new strength
for the struggles and trials that yet faced them in this
perilous campaign upon which they had so courageously
come.</p>

<p>The rear guard was the front of the fighting, and
there the plucky and indomitable Federal leader was
pleading with his soldiers to stand firm and beat off the
pitiless onslaught of the relentless Confederates, who
seemed devilish in their vehement and impetuous
charges. He had chosen men of valor for this work, and
they nobly responded to his every call.</p>

<p>Sitting in their cottage, mayhap talking of the soldier
brother, there fell upon the ears of these defenseless
home-keepers strange sounds: the galloping of horses,
the clanging of swords, frequent shots, sharp, quick
commands. They wondered what all this clamor could
mean, and rushing to the porch, they saw companies
of men clad in blue, all riding in hot haste toward the
bridge over the creek. They were beating and spurring
their brutes, who seemed weary under their human
burdens, and in their dumb way resenting the cruel and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</span>
harsh measures used to drive them to greater and more
strenuous effort. The passers-by jeered the women,
asked them how they liked the “Yanks,” and told them
they had come to thrash the rebels and run Bragg and
his men out of the country. They said “Old Forrest”
was behind them, but they had licked him once and
would do it again.</p>

<p>The well in the yard tempted them to slake their
thirst, and dismounting, they crowded about the
bucket and pulled from its depths draughts to freshen
their bodies and allay the fever that burned in their
tired throats. They asked if they had any brothers
in the army; and not to be outdone, the women said
they had six, and all gone to fight the Yankees. Two
cannon went rumbling by. The men on their horses
were belaboring them with great hickory wythes, and
were driving at a mad pace to get over the wooden
bridge. Some of the blue-coated men came in and
searched the house for guns, pistols, and opened and
pried through the drawers of the wooden bureau, and
looked in the closets and presses and under the beds;
but they found nothing but a side saddle; and one,
more malignant than the others, drew his knife from
a sheath dangling by his side, and slashed and cut its
skirts into small pieces and threw them upon the floor
at the feet of the helpless women.</p>

<p>The line grew thinner. In double and single file
some stragglers were all that was left of the men in
blue, and then the rear guard came, and over the creek
the women saw the cannon on the banks, the horses
unhitched, and the little Federal Army dismounted,
scattered out among the trees and bushes and standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</span>
with guns in their hands, waiting for somebody else
to come. They saw the men tear the rail fence down,
pile the rails on the bridge, and then one started into
the house; and, seizing a piece of blazing coal from the
chimney place, ran in haste to the bridge and set fire
to the brush and rails, and the flames spring high into
the air. They looked down the road and wished that
some men in gray would come and drive away these
rude soldiers who had disturbed the peace of their
home, ungallantly destroying their property, and
cutting into fragments their saddle which had come as a
gift from the dead father whose grave was out in the
woods near the garden gate. As they looked down the
road, they saw one single blue-uniformed man riding at
highest speed, rushing along the highway as if mad,
waving his hands and beating his tired mount with his
sword. Just behind him, at full speed, came other men,
shooting at the fleeing Federals. In front of the
humble home, the single horseman suddenly stopped
and threw up his hands, and cried, “I surrender. I
surrender.” Then up to his side rode with rapid stride
a soldier in gray. He had some stars on his collar and
a wreath about them, and he said to the women, “I am
a Confederate general. I am trying to capture and
kill the Yankee soldiers across the creek yonder.”</p>

<p>Standing on the front porch of the house, these
women watched these startling and surprising proceedings.
The leader who was pursuing this single
soldier in blue sat on his panting steed at the gate.
The young girls knew that the gray uniform meant
friends, rescue, kindness, chivalry. They walked to
the fence and outside the gate touched the bridle of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</span>their deliverer’s steed and patted his foam-covered
neck, and looked up into the face of the stern soldier,
without fear or dread.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p539" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p539.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">MAP SHOWING LINE OF FORREST’S PURSUIT AND CAPTURE OF STREIGHT, AND WISDOM’S RIDE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With tones as tender as those of a woman, the officer
who had captured the Federal vidette said, “Do not
be alarmed. I am General Forrest, and I will protect
you.” Other men in gray came riding in great haste
and speedily dismounting left their horses and scattered
out into the forest on either side of the road. The
youngest girl told the Confederate general that the
Yankees were amongst the trees on the other side of
the creek, and they would kill him if he went down
toward the bridge. She did not realize how little the
man in gray feared the shooting. Now the flames from
the burning rails and bridge timbers began to hiss and
the crackling wood told that the bridge was going into
smoke and ashes and no human power could save it
from ruin and destruction.</p>

<p>The leader said, “I must get across. I must catch
these raiders. Can we ford the creek, or are there any
other bridges near?” “There is no bridge you can
cross,” the younger girl replied, “but you and your men
can get across down there in the woods. If you will
saddle me a horse I’ll go and show you where it is: I
have seen the cows wade there and I am sure you, too,
can cross it.” “Little girl,” the general exclaimed,
“there’s no time for saddling horses. Get up behind
me”; and, seeing a low bank, he pointed her there.
She sprang with the agility of an athlete upon the bank,
and then with a quick leap seated herself behind the
grim horseman, catching onto his waist with her hands.
The soldier pushed his spurs into the flanks of the doubly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</span>
burdened horse and started in a gallop through the
woods, by the father’s grave, along the path indicated
by his youthful guide.</p>

<p>The mother cried out in alarm, and with ill-concealed
fear bade her child dismount. General Forrest
quietly said, “Don’t be alarmed; I’ll take good care
of her and bring her safely back. She’s only going to
show me the ford where I can cross the creek and catch
the Yankees over yonder before they can get to Rome.”
There was something in the look of the warrior that
stilled fear for her child, and with eager gaze, half-way
consenting, she watched them as they galloped across
the corn field. They were soon lost to sight in the
timbered ravine through which the soldier man and
the maiden so firmly seated behind him now passed
out of view. Following the branch a short distance,
General Forrest found that it entered Black Creek
three-fourths of a mile above the bridge. Through the
trees and underbrush, as she saw the muddy waters
of the stream, she warned her companion that they were
where they could be seen by the enemy, and they had
better get down from the horse. Without waiting for
the assistance of her escort, she unloosed her hold from
his waist and sprang to the earth.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp64" id="p543" style="max-width: 54em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p543.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">EMMA SANSOM</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The soldier, throwing his bridle rein over a sapling,
followed the child, who was now creeping on her hands
and knees along the ground over the leaves and through
the thicket. The enemy saw the two forms crouching
on the soil and began to fire at the moving figures
in the bushes. Fearing that she might be struck, the
soldier said, “You can be my guide; but you can’t be
my breastwork,” and, rising, he placed himself in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</span>front of the heroic child, who was fearlessly helping
him in his effort to pursue her country’s foes. Standing
up in full view of the Federals, she pointed where he
must enter and where emerge from the water. Her
mission was ended. The secret of the lost ford was
revealed. Streight’s doom was sealed. The child had
saved Forrest in his savage ride, ten miles and three
hours’ time, and now he felt sure that Rome was safe
and that Streight and his men would soon be captives
in his hands. As they emerged into an open space, the
rain of bullets increased; and the girl, not familiar
with the sound of shot and shell, stood out in full view
and untying her calico sunbonnet, waved it defiantly
at the men in blue across the creek. The firing in an
instant ceased. They recognized the child’s heroic
defiance. Maybe they recalled the face of a sister or
sweetheart away across the Ohio River in Indiana or
Ohio. They were brave, gallant men, the fierceness of
no battle could remove the chivalrous emotions of
manly warriors. Moved with admiration and chivalrous
appreciation of courage, they withdrew their guns
from their shoulders and broke into hurrahs for the
girlish heroine who was as brave as they, and whose
heart, like theirs, rose in the tumult of battle higher
than any fear.</p>

<p>Forrest turned back toward his horse, which was
ravenously eating the leaves and twigs from the bush
where he had been tied. The bullets began whistling
about the retreating forms. She heard the thuds and
zipping of the balls; and, with childish curiosity, asked
the big soldier what these sounds meant. “These are
bullets, my little girl,” he said, “and you must get in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</span>
front of me. One might hit you and kill you.” Two or
three went tearing through her skirt. General Forrest
was greatly alarmed for the safety of his protege. He
covered her more closely and placed his own body as a
bulwark to defend her from shot or shell. He trembled
lest he might be compelled to carry her back dead in
his arms to her mother and sister, and he groaned in
spirit and thought what could he say to the stricken
mother if her child were killed. Death for himself
had no terrors. He had faced it too often to experience
even a tremor, but the strong, brave man shuddered
lest harm should come to the child who had, with so
stout a heart, served him and his country. Riding with
quickening speed, he galloped back to the house. He
tenderly placed his hand upon the red cheeks of the
girl, now glorified in his eyes by her wonderful courage.
He bowed to the mother and sister. He requested the
daring lass for a lock of her hair, and gave orders to
instantly engage the foe. He sent aids to direct the
artillery to the newly-found ford, and while they were
moving with all haste into position, he drew from his
pocket a sheet of unruled paper and wrote on it:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">
<p class="right">
Headquarters in Saddle,<br>
May 2d, 1863.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
</p>

<p>My highest regards to Miss Ema Sansom for her gallant
conduct while my forse was skirmishing with the Federals
across “Black Creek” near Gadisden, Allabama.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">N. B. Forrest</span>,&emsp;<br>

</p>
</div>

<p>In half an hour this simple-hearted, untutored
country child had won enduring renown. She had risen
to the sublimest heights of womanly courage—written
her name on fame’s scroll in most brilliant letterings,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</span>
and taken company with the world’s noblest heroines.
The opportunity came her way, she took advantage of
all it brought, and reaped a harvest of immortality—the
most generous award that fate could bestow.</p>

<p>Emma Sansom married October 29th, 1864, C. B.
Johnson, a private in the 10th Alabama Infantry.
She, with her husband, moved twelve years later to
Calloway County, Texas. Her husband died in 1887,
leaving her to care for five girls and two boys. She
died in 1890 and sleeps in the Lone Star State.</p>

<p>The Gadsden Chapter of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy erected a monument to her memory,
which was dedicated in 1906. It rests on a stone base,
with a statue of General Forrest with Emma Sansom
riding behind. It was built on the banks of the Coosa
River in the city park and has carved on the base,
these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>In memory of the Gadsden, Alabama, girl heroine,
Emma Sansom, who, when the bridge across Black Creek
had been burned by the enemy, mounted behind General
Forrest and showed him a ford where his command
crossed. He pursued and captured that enemy and saved
the city of Rome, Georgia. A grateful people took the
girl into their love and admiration, nor will this marble
outlast the love and pride that her deed inspired.</p>
</div>

<p>The Sansom farm is now the site of Alabama City—a
hustling, vigorous cotton town. Gadsden has grown
to be a flourishing city, the result of the development
of the Alabama iron and cotton trade, and an electric
line connects the two places. The Sansom house still
remains. The family have been widely scattered. A
mill worker rents the old home. The father’s grave,
with its stone monument which was erected to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</span>
memory, is in a cottage yard nearby; but these sad
changes cannot dim the glory of Emma Sansom’s fame,
or depreciate the love and admiration of the men and
women of the Southland for the patriotic courage of
the mountain lass.</p>

<p>Within less than thirty minutes after the time that
Forrest had saluted Emma Sansom, his artillery was
in place, and the Federals on the east side of Black
Creek were driven away. It was short work to cross
the stream. The guns, with ropes tied to the tongues,
were hauled down to the bank of the stream; the ropes
were carried over and hitched to two artillery horses;
and, through the rough ford, the cannon were pulled
across.</p>

<p>These were covered with water; but that did not
hurt the guns. The ammunition was taken out of the
caissons, handed to the soldiers who rode across carrying
it in their arms, and, when on the other side, it was
quickly replaced. No sooner was a portion of the advance
guard across than they took up a furious gait,
pursuing the Federals into Gadsden.</p>

<p>No time was given for Streight and his men to do
damage there. It was now well toward noon of May 2d.
Forrest had kept well in touch with the troops which
were traveling parallel with Streight. They were not
up, but they were in reach. His escort, by wounds,
fatigue and death, had been reduced one-half. The
brave Tennesseans, under Biffle and Starnes, melted
away until there were but five hundred left. Some had
fallen in fatigue and sleep from their steeds. Others
were wounded and died by the roadside. Streight now
realized that there was no escape for him to the west:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</span>
he must go to Rome. He hoped still to outride his
relentless pursuers.</p>

<p>Gadsden, on May 2d, 1863, produced both a heroine
and a hero—Emma Sansom and John H. Wisdom.</p>

<p>The Federals reached Gadsden about twelve
o’clock, m. They came into the town on the main
Blountsville Road, and they came with much haste.
The author had passed through the town five months
before, when on sick leave. It was an insignificant
village and had little to tempt an enemy or to feed a
friend. He rode by the Sansom home, stopped for a
meal, a drink at the well, talked to the mother and two
daughters—little dreaming that the younger would,
in less than half a year, spring into a world-wide
prominence.</p>

<p>The failure to stay Forrest and his followers at
Black Creek had disspirited some of Streight’s officers
and men. These had lost something of their buoyancy
of march, and dark forebodings loomed up in their
minds. They rode as fast as their wearied mounts
would allow, the three and a half miles from the Creek
to Gadsden. Emma Sansom, by revealing the lost
ford—the track the family’s cows so long had used—saved
Forrest much of time and ride. Hardly had the
men in blue dismounted in Gadsden before, a mile out,
they heard the clatter of Enfields and the shouts of
conflict. They had long hoped for a brief rest. They
were confident Forrest would be delayed at least three
hours at Black Creek. They were now to learn that
Forrest’s delays were most uncertain quantities.</p>

<p>A small stock of provender for beasts and food for
man had been collected from the surrounding country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</span>
by the Confederate commissaries; but the country
was illy provisioned and there was but little to either
impress or buy. The vigorous onslaught of the Confederate
vanguard soon drove the Federals out of the
town and the new-comers promptly extinguished the
fires that Streight’s men had kindled.</p>

<p>General Forrest, always well up to the front, rode
rapidly into the village. He divined that Streight
might push on a detachment towards Rome and mayhap
do savage work there before he and Streight might
reach the river. He called for volunteers to ride to
Rome, cover the sixty miles’ space intervening between
Gadsden and Rome, and prepare the people there for
the coming raid. The younger men had long since
gone to the front. The astute Confederate general was
no mean judge of human endurance. Amongst his
wearied men and jaded steeds he doubted if there was
one who would cover the sixty miles in time to save the
town; but to Rome a messenger must go with all speed.</p>

<p>The weight of evidence seems to show that Forrest
sent a messenger of his own. There is no account of
the route he traveled, and no report ever came back to
tell whether he reached Rome. There were men other
than Forrest who loved their country and who would
nobly respond to its call.</p>

<p>John H. Wisdom, familiarly known in that country
as “Deacon Wisdom,” because of his connection with
the Baptist Church, owned the ferry across the Coosa
River at Gadsden. Here the river runs north and south,
and two roads lead to Rome—one on either side of the
stream. Streight chose the one on the west. The ferryman
had gone out into the country in his buggy early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</span>
in the morning, and when he returned at three o’clock
in the afternoon, he proceeded to hunt for his boat,
which had disappeared. He could find no trace of this,
and finally, two neighbors shouted across the stream,
telling him that the Yankee raiders had come into Gadsden
and turned his boat loose and sunk it, and that
they were headed for Rome.</p>

<p>The deacon had heard of the large foundries and
manufactories at Rome. He had never been there,
but he knew their value to his country was beyond
count, and in an instant he caught the burden of a
great mission. He bade his neighbors tell his wife and
children good-bye and to say that he had gone to Rome.</p>

<p>He had read the story of Paul Revere’s Ride.
“Now something greater than that,” he said, “is
passing my way. Revere rode eighteen miles, I must
ride sixty-seven and a half miles, and two-thirds of the
distance along roads of which I know nothing. I hear
voices speaking. They tell me it is my time now—that
fate is beckoning me,” said the bronzed, wiry ferryman.
“I must show myself a real man.” With the
simple faith of a child of God, he turned his eyes heavenward.
He had heard what David has said of Jehovah,
and he prayed thus: “Now, God of Israel! Thou Who
dost neither slumber nor sleep, in the darkness of the
coming night, keep me and help me do this thing for
my country and my people.” The humble ferryman
in an instant had been transformed into a hero.</p>

<p>He sprang into his buggy, and his horse, hitherto
used to kindly and gentle treatment, felt the cruel lash
upon his sides, as with relentless fury his master forced
him along the rough highway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</span></p>

<p>Wisdom calculated that it would take twenty
hours for Streight to reach Rome. He believed that he
could do it in half the time. He knew the road for
twenty-two miles. Beyond that he must trust to the
signboards, to the stars and to the neighbors. The
darkness had no terrors for his brave heart. There were
no telegraph wires, no telephones, and horses were the
only means of rapid transportation. Upon his steed,
and such as he might borrow by the way, he must now
rely to save his nation from irreparable ruin. There
was no time to feed the beast that had already traveled
twenty miles. He led him to the river and let him
drink. Moments were too precious for more. The
weather was propitious and the panting of the weary
animal in the wild dash showed how intent was the
master in his purpose to thwart his people’s foes. This
steed had probably come from Kentucky, where speed
and endurance were part of a horse’s make-up, and now
he must demonstrate that blood will tell. Wisdom
measured the powers of his animal and exacted from
him all that safety and prudence would admit. There
were not many houses on the wayside, but wherever
the hurrying messenger saw a man or a woman or a
child, he cried out—“The Yankees are coming, and they
are on the way to Rome!” Some were incredulous.
Many took his warning words to heart and hid their
horses and mules in the forest and buried their treasures
in the earth. The messenger had no time for roadside
talk. He felt that he was on the King’s business and
must tarry not by the way. His answer to inquiries
was a wave of his hand, then lashing his reeking steed,
and, madman-like, hurrying on.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="p553" style="max-width: 37.9375em;">

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</span></p>
<p>By five forty-five he had covered just one-third of
the distance. He had made twenty-two and one-half
miles. The detours he felt impelled by safety to make
had increased the distance. He had gone about ten
miles an hour. If he could find two horses as good as
his own, he could reach Rome before dawn. He looked
at the sun and wished that, like Joshua of old, he might
bid it stand still.</p>

<p>At the little village of Gnatville, he endeavored to
secure a change of steeds. The best he could find was a
lame pony belonging to the widow Hanks. He unhitched
his weary, foam-covered, panting horse and
led him into the stable. The buggy spindles were burning
hot and it must be abandoned. He must now ride
if he would save Rome. Borrowing a saddle and mounting
the lame pony, he listened to the many appeals
from the widowed owner to go slow. He then started
toward Cave Spring. When out of sight of the pony’s
mistress, he stirred him to greater effort. Night was now
coming on, and the way was exceedingly lonely. He
watched every crossroad, and now and then a fear
passed his mind that he might miss the way. In these
days, in Northern Alabama, there were few who traveled
by the stars. Five miles of vigorous riding and
whipping brought the horseman with his limping
mount to Goshen, a little past sundown. Here he found
a farmer and his son returning from their daily toil
with two plough horses. The deacon pleaded with him
for a horse, and the father finally saddled the two and
told the messenger he could ride one, but his boy would
go with him and bring them back. Darkness now overshadowed
the way. The boy looked upon the forced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</span>
ride with distrust and counseled a slower gait, but the
more the lad protested, the fiercer Deacon Wisdom rode.
In the stillness and silence of the night, they dashed
along in a swift gallop for eleven miles. The riders
exchanged but few words. The jolting of the fierce
gait allowed no waste of breath. Here the messenger
bargained with Preacher Weems for a fresh horse. If
he was to ride nine and one-third miles an hour, no
animal that could be picked up by the way would last
very long. The boy returned with the led horse, but
he had an idea that his companion of the long ride was
an escaped lunatic.</p>

<p>Wisdom cared little for what those he passed thought
of him. He had a message and a vision. All else was
now shut out of his mind. He rode on to John Baker’s—eleven
miles further—and here he got another mount.
No sooner was the messenger out of sight of the owner
of the horse than he rushed into a swifter gait, and going
down hill at a gallop, the horse stumbled and Wisdom
was thrown violently over his head, landing in the middle
of the road. He lay for a few moments unconscious,
while the beast stood near, munching the bushes in the
fence corner. Thought came back, and, half dazed, he
pleaded with God to let him continue his journey. The
thought that he might now fail burdened his soul with
profound grief. He rubbed his limbs, pressed his temples,
relaxed his hands, reached down and drew up
his feet. In a few minutes complete consciousness
and motion returned. Crawling, he reached the horse,
and with his hand on the stirrup, he pulled himself half
way up and finally after much effort he managed to
get into the saddle again. Once again mounted, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</span>
held the reins with firmer grip, but still relentlessly
drove his steed.</p>

<p>Twelve miles more brought him within six miles of
Rome. It was now half past eleven o’clock at night.
He told his errand and asked for another horse. The
farmer gladly granted his request, and whipping into
a gallop, Wisdom soon saw the lights of Rome. He
anxiously peered through the darkness to see if the
great wooden bridge over the Oostenaula was still
standing. He could distinguish no flames or beacon
lights of destruction along Streight’s pathway, and he
knew then that he was the first to Rome. A great joy
welled up in his heart. He had not spared himself,
and he had saved his country.</p>

<p>He had started late, but he started fresh. He had,
as Forrest would say, “gotten the bulge on the blue
coats,” and had beaten them in the game of war.</p>

<p>From three-thirty in the afternoon until twelve
o’clock was eight and one-half hours. He calculated
that he had lost, in changing horses and by his fall
in the road, an hour and thirty minutes. That gave
him seven hours’ actual driving and riding time. He
had made an average of over nine and a third miles in
every hour he had been in the buggy and in the saddle.
He had been faithful to his country’s call.</p>

<p>There were no citizens to receive him. He trotted
through the deserted streets of Rome to the leading
hotel, kept by G. S. Black, and in impetuous, fiery
tones made known the cause and reason of his coming.
He pleaded with the landlord that there was no time
for delay, that everybody must awake and get busy
and drive back the Yankees. The inn-keeper told him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</span>
to ride up and down the streets and tell the startling
news. It was a strange sight and strange sound as
this weary horseman shouted in the highways of Rome,
“The Yankees are coming! The Yankee raiders are
coming to burn up the town.” Some believed, some
doubted, but still the tired man cried out and with shrill
calls he yelled, “Wake up! Wake up! The Yankees
are coming!” Rome was not as big then as it is now.
Half dressed, scurrying hither and thither, old men and
boys came rushing out on the sidewalk to inquire the
details of the startling story of the Federal invaders.
The women and children, slower of movement, soon
joined the excited throngs, and with speechless wonderment
hung with breathless interest upon every word
that fell from Deacon Wisdom’s lips. The court house
and church bells rung out with dismal warnings.
These sounds terrified even brave hearts, but to the
mothers and their clinging offspring, they appeared as
omens of woe and disaster. Rome was stirred as never
before, and for the moment there was dismay and direful
dread.</p>

<p>There were some in this appalling hour who knew
what to do. One-armed and one-legged soldiers and
convalescents were there, and in a moment they became
the recognized leaders. Squirrel rifles, shotguns and
old muskets—such as were left—were pressed into use
and a little railroad from Rome to Kingston made rapid
trips, bringing in all who were willing to help defend
the town.</p>

<p>A little way out from Rome was the bridge across
the Oostenaula River. It was the only gateway from
the west into the city. Negro teamsters were awakened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</span>
horses and mules were harnessed and hitched to wagons,
the warehouses were broken open and everybody began
to haul out cotton bales and pile them along the highway
by which Streight must ride to reach the bridge
or the town. The sides of the bridge were filled with
straw, and great stacks were piled on the roof. The
straw was saturated with turpentine, so that when the
test moment came, if the soldiers could not beat back
the assailants, a flaming bridge would bar the way of
the blue-coated invaders into the city. At least, it
would stay their coming until the implacable Forrest,
in their rear, might reach the scene of action.</p>

<p>Captain Russell, the Federal vanguard leader, had
ridden as hard as he could ride with his weary men and
his tired steeds. A little after sun-up, he approached
the stream west of Rome, and when he looked he saw
cotton breastworks and soldiers with guns behind them.
On the hill outside the town he met an old negro woman
and inquired if there were any soldiers in Rome, and
she answered, “Yes, Massa, de town am full of sogers,”
and then he knew that he had lost and that the day
ride and the long night ride, with all their suffering, had
been without avail; that, though he had done all that
he and his followers could do, fate had decreed that
Rome should be saved. The defenders began to exchange
shots with the invaders. The men at the bridge
fired the cannon. The Federals answered with their
carbines, but the casualties were few. Russell, with
his two hundred followers, had done all men could do.
They had come as fast as they could march; they had
acquitted themselves as intrepid heroes; but John H.
Wisdom, the brave, hardy Baptist deacon, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</span>
language of Forrest, had “gotten there first,” had beat
them to the town and told them of their coming.
Fate had decreed that Streight must fail, and Russell,
with a heart full of sorrow and disappointment, faced
about and rode back to meet his chief. While Russell
looked over the river at Rome, Streight was fighting
at the Black Creek Bridge. The people of Rome
presented Deacon Wisdom with a silver service, still
preserved by his descendants as a priceless treasure,
and they sent to widow Hanks, the owner of the lame
pony, a purse of $400.</p>

<p>Darkness, Streight’s best friend, began to hover
over his weary and depleted brigade. He had directed
Russell to ride over all barriers and to let nothing deflect
him on the road to Rome. If he failed, he hoped
Russell would succeed. Russell, through the long,
long hours of the night, faithful to his orders, rode and
rode and rode. After six hours of tireless effort, Russell
reached the Chatooga River. He found a small ferryboat
and managed to get his men over; but he forgot
a most important thing. He failed to leave a guard to
protect the little craft so that his comrades could find
some means of crossing when they arrived. The citizens
calculated the value of the craft and poling it down the
stream, hid it where Streight’s men, in the dark, would
never discover its whereabouts.</p>

<p>Streight rode all night and struck the Chatooga
River where Russell had crossed some hours before.
He realized that he must go higher to get over. He
found a bridge above; but it cost him a weary, dreary
night’s march. Several times his detachments lost
each other, and it was not until daylight in the morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</span>
of the 3d of May that he got his last man across the
river. He burned the bridge. He made no halts. He
had marched twenty-eight miles from Gadsden under
appalling difficulties. Most men would have stopped
and either surrendered or died in the last ditch; but
Streight had started to Rome, and to Rome he was
bound to go. In this last effort, he reached Lawrence.
A little way off, near the Georgia line, he ordered his
men to halt; but there was no use for an order to halt.
Nature, the greatest of captains, issued its command;
and, while their ears were open, they heard and heeded
no voices, but sank down on the ground—unconscious
and powerless in sleep.</p>

<p>Streight had found some provender: his horses were
as weary as his men. Still brave and hopeful, with a
few of his iron-hearted and almost iron-bodied officers,
he rode through the camp, picking out here and there
a man, who with a stronger physique than his comrades
had stood the pressure of the tremendous ride
and incessant fighting. These he directed to feed the
horses of their less vigorous companions. A little
while before going into camp, Streight passed another
ordeal. A squad of his returning soldiers told him the
story of Captain Russell’s failure. There were no foes
in front of Russell. Streight was between him and the
pursuers. He had hoped great things from this vanguard,
and when he learned that Russell had turned
back, even his brave soul began to question whether,
after all he had dared and suffered, he must at last
fail.</p>

<p>The scouts told him that Russell had seen Rome,
but as an ancient negro said, “Dat Rome is plum full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</span>
of sogers and dem big guns is a p’intin’ down all de
roads.”</p>

<p>Russell had lost out, and his mission, upon which he
had gone with high hopes and bright expectations, had
failed, and with a heart burdened with disappointment
and chagrin, Streight’s messenger had turned his face
back to the west.</p>

<p>He understood how Russell might have ridden
through to East Tennessee, or marched north to the
Tennessee River, but Streight was glad he had not deserted
his commander and had come back to face with
courage any disaster or ruin that the end might bring.</p>

<p>No thought of yielding came into Streight’s mind.
If he had chosen to map out the future, rather than
surrender, he would have preferred death on the field
amid the carnage and storm of conflict. No call of
patriotism, no appeal of duty, no echo of glory could
reach the ears of his men, now dull with sleep, or bodies
overwhelmed with weariness. In the midst of these sad
and harassing surroundings, with two-thirds of his command
asleep on the ground, his persistent enemies
again appeared on the scene. They looked to him to be
tireless, vindictive, and with a strength more than human.
Streight, still game, fearless, called upon his
men to respond to the rifle shots which came whizzing
from the guns of the Confederate advance. No order
or pleading could move the men, now unconscious with
sleep. With a touch of mercy in this supreme hour,
when they were put into the line of battle, they had
been told to lie down with their faces to the foe. When
the foe came, they were reposing prone upon the earth,
with their guns in their hands, cocked; but the motionless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</span>fingers had no will power behind them to pull the
triggers; and thus, ready for battle; ready, if awake,
to die—but unconscious and silent, they lay immovable
and helpless. Streight walked through the ranks of
his once valiant soldiers; and, pleading with tears in
his eyes, begged them once more to rise and defend
themselves from the foe—men, who, like mad devils,
had relentlessly pursued them for one hundred and
twenty hours.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p563" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p563.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">JOHN H. WISDOM AND THE BLACK CREEK BRIDGE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the midst of this direful extremity, Forrest appeared
at the head of his vanguard a few hundred feet
away. He was surprised that only a few shots were
fired by the enemy, and that of those he was fighting
and pursuing, there rose up only here and there an
isolated form. He sent forward a flag of truce, demanding
surrender. This Streight refused; but consented
to imparl with the Confederate chieftain. These two
brave men met between their lines. Forrest told
Streight he had him surrounded, and that therefore
resistance was useless; that it could only result in loss
of life, and that, in view of the experiences of the past
few days, it might be that no prisoners would be taken.
Streight inquired how many men he had with him, to
which Forrest replied, “More than enough to whip
you, and I have more coming.” Fortunately, Forrest’s
artillery appeared upon the scene. They came slowly,
lashing and slashing the exhausted beasts as they
dragged the heavy guns through the sand. Streight
requested that they should not come nearer; but out
in the road they made the appearance of more guns
than Forrest really had. Streight, disturbed and still
defiant, but not despairing, rode back and called a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</span>
council of war. In saddened tones, rendered even
sadder by fatigue and exhaustion, his officers advised
surrender. They were as brave as Streight, but they
had less to lose. They took a more rational view of
the desperateness of the surroundings, and without a
dissenting voice advised a capitulation. Fearlessly
and dauntless of spirit, Streight still urged a last
conflict. He pled with them for one more fight, telling
them that Forrest’s men were as tired as they were
and they ought not to yield with fourteen hundred
soldiers in line; but the burdens of wearied nature
depressed their brave spirits and they said, “We had
better yield.”</p>

<p>With a calmness and courage born of a spirit that
knew not fear and with grief depicted on every lineament,
if not with tears streaming down his cheek,
he told his comrades that he yielded to their judgment;
but he would never vote to give up the fight. Forrest
was glad enough to get the surrender. He granted
most honorable terms, retention of side arms and
personal property. The sleepers were awakened and
marched out into an open field and stacked their guns,
and Forrest’s weary, tired men, marched between them
and their only hope. Disarmed, there was nothing to
do but accept the sad fortune of a defeat. Defeat it
was; but these men were glorious even in defeat.
Streight had only one request to make—that his men
might give three cheers for the Union, and this was
done with lusty shouts and enthusiasm in the Alabama
forest. These brave men, valiant and loyal even in
defeat, flung into the faces of their triumphant foes
hurrahs for their cause and their country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</span></p>

<p>Streight says, “Nature was exhausted. A large
portion of my best troops actually went to sleep while
lying in the line of battle under a heavy skirmish fire.”</p>

<p>Confederates and Federals were marched into Rome.
To the Confederates, it was the greatest triumphal
march of the western war. Brave men pitied the misfortune
of the Federal raiders. They deserved, though
they had not achieved, success.</p>

<p>War’s wrecks were yet to be collected: there
were Federal and Confederate wounded along the line
of this remarkable march who were witnesses to war’s
savageness. The surgeons had hastily dressed wounds
and amputated limbs; but somebody must now go
back and gather up and care for these ghastly evidences
of the horribleness of battle; and, with these, ended
one of the most remarkable of all the experiences in
cavalry service on either side from 1861 to 1865.</p>

<p>Streight was carried to Richmond and confined in
Libby prison, and with one hundred other officers
escaped through a tunnel in February, 1864. Hid by
friends for a week, he finally reached the Federal lines;
and, undaunted, returned to his regiment. He was
offered command of Chattanooga; but, still brave and
active, he declined the post and asked to be assigned
to active service in the field. He was yet to see more
of war. He was at Dalton when it was besieged by
Wheeler. He was at the Battle of Nashville in the
winter of 1864, and commanded a brigade in that
memorable conflict. He was mustered out of the service
in 1865, returned to Indianapolis, Indiana, and
opened a furniture manufactory, and afterwards developed
a wholesale lumber business. A man of such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</span>
tremendous energy and physical endurance was bound
to be successful. Elected State Senator from Marion
County, of which Indianapolis is the county seat, he
introduced a bill for the erection of the magnificent
capitol since constructed at Indianapolis. In 1880
he was candidate for governor; but was defeated by
Albert G. Porter. He died at his home near Indianapolis
in 1892, in the 63d year of his age. He was never
fully appreciated by his countrymen; and, when the
story of his raid shall be fully and fairly told, he will
take a high rank among Federal heroes.</p>

<p>General Joseph E. Johnson once said of Forrest
that if he had received a military education, he would
have been the greatest figure of the war. General
Sherman declared Forrest was the greatest cavalry
genius in the world’s history. It was his judgment
that if Forrest had been educated at West Point, it
would have spoiled him; that he was greater as an
untutored military genius than if he had received the
benefits of the most thorough martial education.</p>

<p>North and South, the story of Streight’s pursuit
filled the people with wonder. In the South, to wonder
was added an admiration which became almost idolatry.
The men and women of the Confederacy might
well adore this marvelous soldier. They placed him
on the highest pedestal. He was so great and so brave
that they saw none of the defects of his character, and
nothing could make them believe but that he was all
that was good and true and patriotic and grand.
They looked upon him as a fierce, intrepid, determined,
successful cavalry soldier, who was ever courageous
of heart, in whose bosom fear never found place, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</span>
before whom difficulties melted away whenever the
touch of his transcendent power passed their way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_XX"><span class="smcap">Chapter XX</span><br>
<span class="smcap">BATTLE OF FLEETWOOD HILL,<br>
JUNE 9th, 1863</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The Battle of Chancellorsville was fought on the
3d of May, 1863. It stands in military history
as one of the remarkable battles of the world.
It was a great victory in one sense for the Confederate
Army, but on that fatal field died Stonewall Jackson,
one of the wonderful soldiers of the ages.</p>

<p>Amidst the gloom of an unsuccessful campaign, and
when defeat was apparently impending about his hosts,
a brave European general gathered around him his
several commanders and asked of them a detailed
enumeration of the forces that could be depended upon
in the approaching conflict. Conscious of the inferiority
of numbers, the reports were made, with countenances
and words showing the profound fear of misfortune
on the coming day. Distressed by this despondence,
the unterrified leader rose and striking the table with
his hands, vehemently cried out: “How many do you
count me?” Instantly the scene changed. His courage
restored the waning valor of his followers. In all
battles the Confederate soldiers in Northern Virginia,
who came in contact with General Jackson, counted
him alone a mighty host.</p>

<p>In May and June, 1863, hope was still radiant in
the hearts and minds of the defenders of Southern
independence. The superb defense of Vicksburg, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</span>
well as Port Hudson, indicated that the possession of
the Mississippi was yet a debatable proposition, and
that the division of the Confederacy by the capture
of that mighty stream would be long delayed. The
crushing of Hooker at Chancellorsville demonstrated
that none of the efficiency and power of the Army of
Northern Virginia was gone. Beyond the Mississippi,
the position of the army there made it certain that many
months would come and go before the Union forces
would be able to get very far south of the Arkansas
River.</p>

<p>Soldiers as brave and self-reliant as the men of the
Army of Northern Virginia had grounds of hope that
ordinary soldiers could not feel. They were made of
the best metal and fashioned in the finest mold, and
thus could hope when others might despair.</p>

<p>The first sting of the death of Stonewall Jackson
had abated. General Stuart had won honor when Jackson
had fallen, and there were many, many great
soldiers in this army of Northern Virginia who felt the
uplift of faith in God, and these could but believe that
in the end, some way, another leader would be developed
to help General Lee in the future, and be to
him what Jackson had been in the earlier campaigns
of that loved commander.</p>

<p>The Battle of Fleetwood Hill, sometimes called
“Brandy Station,” was almost entirely a cavalry contest.
It was fought on the 9th of June, 1863. Some
of the most important as well as desperate scenes of
the battle were on what was known as “Fleetwood
Hill.” This was the center of a once beautiful estate.
War had despoiled some of its grandeur, but even in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</span>
its ruin it was magnificent. The storm of conflict
raged from dawn to late in the afternoon, with unabating
fury. Men on both sides seemed immune to fatigue
or fear, and for fourteen hours, as if endued with
supernatural energy and power, struggled amidst
dust, smoke, starvation and wounds and death with
unflagging fury, in the maddening work of ruin and
destruction. This hill was adorned by a colonial
mansion. The ground about it rose with gradual
ascent until it reached the top of the eminence, from
which point there fell upon the gaze of the beholder one
of the most beautiful views in Virginia. This country
had hitherto been rendered famous by some of the
greatest of military achievements known to men.
Later it would add new titles to historic greatness with
the names of Second Manassas, Spottsylvania and Cold
Harbor, but on this day it was to crown the cavalry
of both the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army
of the Potomac with a glow that would never dim.</p>

<p>Culpepper Court House was the county seat of
Culpepper County, and within the limits of this county
was situated Fleetwood Hill. It was fifty miles from
Washington, and Brandy Station was five miles south
of the north fork of the Rappahannock River. From
Kelley’s Ford on the Rappahannock River to Brandy
Station was five and a half miles; from Kelley’s Ford
to Stevensburg was seven miles; from Brandy Station
to St. James Church was one mile and a half; and
from Brandy Station to Beverly’s Ford on the Rappahannock
River was four miles. From Fleetwood Hill
to St. James Church was one mile, and from Kelley’s
Ford to Beverly’s Ford, three miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</span></p>


<h3>GENERAL ALFRED PLEASANTON</h3>

<p>The Federal forces were commanded by General
Alfred Pleasanton, who was born in Washington City,
June 7th, 1824. In 1844 he graduated from the United
States Military Academy and became second lieutenant
in the First Dragoons. He was at Palo Alto and at
Resaca de La Palma. He was in the Seminole war
and in operations in Washington Territory, Oregon
and Kansas. In February, 1861, he became major of
the Second United States Cavalry and marched with
his regiment from Utah to Washington. He was in the
Peninsula Campaign of 1862 and in July of that year
was appointed brigadier general of volunteers. By
September he was a division commander. He was at
Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg and at Chancellorsville.
His friends claimed that he stayed the advance of
Stonewall Jackson on May 2d, 1863. He was at
Gettysburg and subsequently transferred to Missouri.
He was made a brigadier general in the regular army
in 1865, for meritorious conduct, and mustered out in
1866. He was a vigorous and daring leader and won a
splendid reputation by hard fighting. Later in the
struggle he was transferred to the West and won some
signal victories in Missouri, and was at one time offered
the command of the Army of the Potomac.</p>


<h3>JOHN BUFORD</h3>

<p>General Pleasanton had with him as second in
command John Buford, who was born in Kentucky
in 1825. He was graduated from the Military Academy
at West Point in 1848, and became second lieutenant
in the First Dragoons. He was in the Sioux expedition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</span>
in 1855, in Kansas in 1856 and ’57, and in the Utah
expedition in 1857 and ’58. In 1861 he was promoted
to be a major and was designated inspector general of
a corps in November, 1861. He was on General Polk’s
staff in 1862. On the 27th day of July he was made
brigadier-general and given command of a cavalry
brigade composed of some of the very best of Federal
cavalry, the 1st Michigan, the 5th New York, 1st
Vermont and 1st West Virginia. He was wounded
at the Second Manassas. In the Maryland campaign
he was acting chief of cavalry of the Army of the Potomac.
He was also at Antietam. Upon the organization
of the cavalry of the Army of the Potomac, General
Stoneman became the ranking officer, and Buford
commanded the reserve cavalry. He was at Fredericksburg,
December 3d, 1862, in Stoneman’s raid on Richmond
in May, 1863, at Beverly Ford, June, 1863. He
was at Gettysburg and his associates felt that he did
wonderful service there. At Fleetwood Hill, he did
some of the best fighting. He was not afraid of any
sort of clash with his enemies. He died in November,
1863, and a statue at Gettysburg commemorates his
work there.</p>


<h3>GEORGE WESLEY MERRITT</h3>

<p>General George Wesley Merritt was born in New
York City, June 16th, 1836. He went to West Point
in 1855, graduating in 1860, and was assigned at once
to the cavalry service. By April 5th, 1862, he was captain
of the 2d United States Cavalry. He served on the
staff of General Phillips and St. George Cooke; later,
under General Stoneman. By April 3d, 1863, he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</span>
attained to the command of the 2d United States
Cavalry. He saw the fighting at Gettysburg. He was
at Yellow Tavern, where Stuart received his fatal
wound. By June 29th, 1863, he had become a brigadier
general. He was with Sherman in the Shenandoah
campaign and in 1864 was made major general. He
was one of the three Federal commissioners to arrange
the terms of surrender at Appomattox. In June, 1898,
he was appointed military governor of the Philippine
Islands, and with an army of eight thousand men
arrived at Manila on June 25th. His active military
career covered a period of nearly forty years, and he
witnessed some of the most desperate and effective
fighting of any soldier who served in the army to which
his life was devoted.</p>


<h3>BENJAMIN FRANKLIN DAVIS</h3>

<p>With General Pleasanton also on that day was
Benjamin Franklin Davis, who was born in Alabama
in 1832, graduated from the United States Military
Academy in 1854, and served with great credit in both
infantry and cavalry in Mexico. In 1861 he sided
against the state of his nativity. In 1862 he became
colonel of the 8th New York Cavalry and was in command
of a brigade of Federals in this engagement.
With Wesley Merritt, D. McM. Gregg and Colonel
A. N. Duffie, this made a splendid aggregation of cavalry
experience and military genius.</p>

<p>General Pleasanton had under him ten thousand
nine hundred and eighty soldiers. The best the Federal
Army had in cavalry at that time was at Fleetwood.
The generals in command were brave, able and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</span>
experienced. They had been prodded about what
Stuart had been doing. Their pride and courage were
involved and aroused, and they were longing for an
opportunity, which had now come, to have a real test
of the spirit and grit of the Confederate cavalry.</p>

<p>The horsemen of the Union armies had now been
taught both how to ride and how to shoot. They were
well mounted and well armed, and their training made
them formidable foes. The war had now been in
progress for two years and the Federal cavalry drill
and training had been brought to a very high standard.
The Federal troopers had become apt scholars. They
were anxious to demonstrate their valor, their discipline
and their power.</p>

<p>On the Confederate side were nine thousand five
hundred and thirty-six men, and these constituted the
best horsemen the Army of Northern Virginia could
send into battle—in fact, about all it could offer.
Stuart himself had long since established a reputation
as one of the most enterprising and successful of cavalry
leaders, and he had with him lieutenants who were as
brave and as able as any who could be found. The
generals and men under him were superb horsemen and
accurate shots when the war began. To great pride
they had added wide experience in campaigning.
Well educated, highly bred, and intensely patriotic,
they were foemen the most intrepid men might justly
fear.</p>


<h3>WILLIAM HENRY FITZHUGH LEE</h3>

<p>Major General William Henry Fitzhugh Lee was
a son of Robert E. Lee and was born on May 21st, 1837.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</span>
Graduating at Harvard when he was twenty years of
age, he was appointed second lieutenant in the 6th
Infantry, and he served under Albert Sidney Johnson
in Utah and California. In 1859 he resigned his commission
to operate his farm, known as the “White
House,” on the Pamunky River, which became not
only important as a strategic position, but famous
in the history of the war. At the beginning of 1861, he
organized a company of cavalry and later became a
major in the new-made Confederate Army. In West
Virginia he was chief of cavalry for General Loring.
In the winter of 1861 and ’62, he was commissioned
lieutenant colonel of the 9th Virginia, and in less than
two months became its colonel. His regiment constituted
a part of the brigade of General J. E. B. Stuart.
In the Chickahominy raid he was one of the three
colonels with Stuart, and his troops defeated the Federal
cavalry on June 13th in this expedition. He suffered
rough treatment at Boonsboro. He was knocked from
his horse and left unconscious by the roadside; but
reached Sharpsburg in time for the fight. He rode with
Stuart in the Chambersburg raid. His courage and
intrepidity saved Stuart, by protecting the ford at
which he must cross. In November Lee became
brigadier general. He was prominent at Fredericksburg
and Chancellorsville, and at Fleetwood he was
captured after being severely wounded. He was carried
to Fortress Monroe and subsequently to Fort LaFayette
and was exchanged in March, 1864. At this time he
was promoted to be a major general and commanded
a division of Confederate cavalry in the Army of
Northern Virginia. He was with General Lee, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</span>
father, to the end. After the war he returned to his
plantation. He was a member of the Fiftieth, Fifty-first
and Fifty-second Congresses from the Eighth
Virginia District and died at Alexandria in 1901.</p>


<h3>WILLIAM CARTER WICKHAM</h3>

<p>Another prominent leader on the Confederate side
was William Carter Wickham, who was born in Richmond,
Virginia, in 1820. He graduated at the University
of Virginia in 1842. He was bitterly opposed
to the war and voted against the Ordinance of Secession.
He recruited, however, the Hanover Dragoons, was
in the first battle of Manassas, and in September, 1861,
was made lieutenant colonel of the 4th Virginia Cavalry,
and in August, 1862, became colonel of that regiment.
He rendered valiant service at the Second Manassas,
at Boonsboro and at Sharpsburg. At Upperville he
was wounded the second time, and took part in the
Battle of Fredericksburg, December 12th, 1862. Elected
to Congress in 1863, he remained with his regiment
until the fall of 1864. He helped to stop Kilpatrick’s
raid on Richmond and Custer’s attack on Charlottesville.
He was in the Battle of the Wilderness and at
Spottsylvania Court House, and was with Stuart on
May 11th, at Yellow Tavern. The last brigade order
issued by General Stuart was to General Wickham to
dismount his brigade and attack. Wickham was with
Early in the valley. After the reverse at Fisher’s Hill,
he stayed the advance so as to allow the reorganization
of Early’s forces. On the 5th of October, 1864, he
resigned his commission in the army, transferring his
command to General Rosser, and took a seat in Congress.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</span>
He died in Richmond, Virginia, in 1888. The
state of Virginia erected a statue to his memory on the
capitol grounds in Richmond.</p>


<h3>BEVERLY HOLCOMBE ROBERTSON</h3>

<p>Brigadier General Beverly Holcombe Robertson
was a graduate of the United States Military Academy
in 1849, and became second lieutenant in the Second
Dragoons. By hard service in the West he was promoted
to first lieutenant in 1859, and was under
Edgerton of the Second Dragoons in the Utah campaign.
He severed his connection with the United States Army
and became a colonel in the Virginia cavalry. He was
sent to take command of Ashby’s cavalry. In September,
1863, he was assigned to the command of the Department
of North Carolina, and took charge of the
organization and training of cavalry troops. Immediately
preceding the battle at Fleetwood, he was sent
to reinforce Stuart. He was at Gettysburg and in the
raid through Maryland. After returning from Gettysburg,
the regiments comprising his brigade were so
reduced that he sought service in another field, and was
given command of the Second Division of South
Carolina. His cavalry forces were particularly prominent
in the Battle of Charles City Cross Roads, and
in the battles with Sherman’s troops, on their march
to the sea, he bore a valiant and distinguished part.</p>


<h3>JOHN RANDOLPH CHAMBLISS</h3>

<p>General John Randolph Chambliss was born in
Greenville County, Virginia, in 1833, and graduated
from the United States Military Academy in 1853.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</span>
In July, 1861, he was commissioned colonel of the 13th
Virginia Cavalry, and was under the orders of General
D. H. Hill on the James River during the fall of that
year. He was assigned to General W. H. F. Lee’s
cavalry brigade, and was regarded as one of the most
determined and intrepid fighters. After General
W. H. F. Lee’s wound and the death of Colonel Sol
Williams, Colonel Chambliss took command of the
brigade. He was at Gettysburg and in the Bristoe
skirmish. In December, 1864, he was commissioned
brigadier general. In the cavalry battle at Charles
City Cross Roads on the north side of the James River,
he was killed on the 16th of August, 1864. His body
was buried by his enemies, but was afterwards delivered
to his friends. General Lee, in speaking of his
death, said: “The loss sustained by the cavalry in the
fall of General Chambliss will be felt throughout the
army. By his courage, energy and skill, he had won
for himself an honored name.”</p>


<h3>WILLIAM E. JONES</h3>

<p>General William E. Jones, another of the Confederate
leaders, was born in Washington County, Virginia,
in May, 1824. He graduated from West Point in 1848.
He did splendid service in the West. At the time of the
passage of the Ordinance of Secession by Virginia, he
had organized a company of cavalry known as the
Washington Mounted Rifles. His company was part
of General Stuart’s command. He became colonel of
the 1st Virginia Cavalry with Fitzhugh Lee as lieutenant
colonel. In 1862 he was displaced by regimental
election, and was assigned to the 7th Virginia regiment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</span>
He was at Sharpsburg and was promoted on November
8th to be brigadier general and was assigned to the
command of the Laurel Brigade. In April and May,
1863, he conducted a daring and successful raid on
the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, west of Cumberland.
From this expedition he joined Stuart, and at Brandy
Station no leader acquitted himself more splendidly.
At Boonsboro his command captured over six hundred
Federal prisoners. In 1861 differences had begun
between General Stuart and Colonel Jones. This
became so intense that it was necessary to remove
Colonel Jones, and he was sent to Southwestern Virginia.
A man of splendid executive ability, he organized
an excellent brigade and was with Longstreet in
Tennessee. He prevented Averell from destroying
the salt works in Southwestern Virginia. On May 23d,
1864, he was placed in command of the Department of
Southwestern Virginia, while General Breckinridge
was absent in the valley. In the fight at Piedmont,
Virginia, he fell, leading his forces in the conflict, and
his body was not recovered until after the battle.</p>


<h3>THOMAS TAYLOR MUNFORD</h3>

<p>Another officer of deserved distinction was General
Thomas Taylor Munford, who was born in Richmond
in 1831. He graduated from the Virginia Military
Institute in 1852. At the outbreak of the war he was a
planter. He became lieutenant colonel of the 30th
Virginia Mounted Infantry, organized in 1861. This
was the first mounted regiment organized in Virginia.
It was subsequently designated as the 2d Regiment of
Cavalry, General Stuart’s regiment being the 1st. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</span>
the re-organization under Stuart, Munford became
colonel. He was in the first fighting and the last fighting
of the Army of Northern Virginia. His career as a
cavalry officer was brilliant and notable. The discharge
of all duties committed to him were performed
with absolute faithfulness. When General Ashby died,
General Munford was recommended by General Robert
E. Lee as his successor. He received two severe
wounds at the Second Manassas. He was in the Maryland
campaign, was at Sharpsburg and commanded a
division of cavalry that confronted Hancock’s troops.
Later he became commander of Fitzhugh Lee’s brigade.
He was at Gettysburg and in the valley campaign with
Early. In November, 1864, he was promoted to brigadier
general. At Five Forks and at High Bridge he
maintained the splendid reputation that he had won
in the earlier days of the war. He was with Rosser at
High Bridge, and, in the retreat from Richmond, bore
both a prominent and valiant part. After Lee’s surrender,
he endeavored to collect the scattered Confederate
forces and form a junction with Johnson’s army.
General Fitzhugh Lee commanded his excellent services
as a division commander. With large agricultural
interests in Virginia and Alabama, he still survives,
full of honors and full of years, and occupies a most
exalted place in the hearts of his Confederate comrades.</p>

<p>At no other place in the war were such a large
number of cavalry engaged in a single conflict. It was
practically forty per cent more men than were engaged
in any one cavalry battle during hostilities, and in few
battles were such a large proportion of the leaders
West Point graduates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</span></p>

<p>On the 22d of May General Stuart reviewed the
brigades of Fitzhugh Lee, W. H. F. Lee and Wade
Hampton. He counted four thousand troopers. This
review occurred between Brandy Station and Culpepper
Court House, and a sense of pride and exaltation filled
Stuart’s heart as he looked over the chivalrous and
intrepid legions. A few days later there came over
from the valleys of Virginia General William E. Jones,
who brought with him a brigade of fairly well mounted
and armed men. They were of splendid material.
There also came from North Carolina another brigade
under General Beverly H. Robertson. Stuart’s forces
now numbered five brigades, constituting a magnificent
array of cavalrymen. Always proud, he announced a
great review for June 5th. He wanted himself and he
wanted others to see in array this grand body of horsemen,
in every respect the equal of any nine thousand
men who ever aligned as cavalry. He asked General
Robert E. Lee to be present and to impress these troops
with a sight of his magnificent personality. These
horsemen rode, and walked, trotted and galloped, and
salvos of artillery magnified the splendor of the movements
and thrilled the hearts of the riders. General
Lee could not come, but General Stuart had all that
the pomp and pageantry of war at that date in Virginia
could present.</p>

<p>General Stuart, still anxious that General Lee
should see his men and that the men should see him,
announced another review and parade for the 8th day
of June. Many of the horses were the worse for wear,
the men’s uniforms were worn, faded and many threadbare,
but the sabres, guns and pistols were bright,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</span>
and if their equipment showed the marks of heavy
service, their hearts were true and loyal to their beloved
country and they were ready to respond to its every
call.</p>

<p>The mind of the Confederate commander was revolving
the scheme of the invasion of Pennsylvania,
which was to culminate three weeks later at Gettysburg.
He was prone to look at things more quietly
than General Stuart, and so he reviewed this important
part of the army of Northern Virginia, but he forbade
the discharge of artillery, and he only allowed them to
pass by him at a walk and trot. He knew who and what
they were and he knew that when the testing moment
came they would be worthy of the Confederacy.
Neither General Lee nor General Stuart had any
foreshadowing of what the next day would bring forth,
and General Lee returned to his headquarters in the
midst of his infantry. Stuart’s headquarters were at
Fleetwood Hill. General Pleasanton’s headquarters
were across the Rappahannock River, eight miles
away. Neither seemed to know just what the other
was doing. Pleasanton had marched his men down
the Rappahannock. He allowed no fires. He had been
sent by General Hooker to find out just what General
Lee was doing and where his army was encamped.
Two fords were accessible, Beverly’s Ford and Kelley’s
Ford. General Pleasanton had resolved to use both to
force the fighting and to back up the cavalry with
infantry, to drive anything out of his way that might
cross his path. Stuart, unconscious of the large force
of cavalry and infantry that was ready to cross the
Rappahannock, had his men at and about St. James<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</span>
Church, over at Fleetwood Hill, and down at Beverly’s
Ford.</p>

<p>Pleasanton had with him some splendid artillery,
especially the 6th New York Battery. At Chancellorsville,
thirty-seven days before, it had written history,
and on the morrow it was to write history again at
Fleetwood. With thirty men beginning the day,
it would bring out unscathed only six; four-fifths
were to go down in the storm.</p>

<p>New Jersey, New York, Maine, Pennsylvania and
Rhode Island were getting ready with their troops to
try out the question of the courage and endurance of
the horsemen from Virginia, North Carolina, Mississippi,
South Carolina and Georgia.</p>

<p>There was to be an all-day fight, and it was to be a
hand-to-hand fight. It was to be a fight in which the
sabre would be used. The ever-handy revolver was
to be an incident. The highest type of courage was
to play an important part. In this hard-fought contest
cowards would have no place. If there was cowardice
hovering around on that day it did not come to the
surface. Valor oozed out from the pores of the actors.
The very atmosphere was full of courageous inspiration.
Death would lose its terrors on Fleetwood Hill,
and fear would be relegated to the rear. Smoke and
dust would obscure the sight but could not and would
not affect the courage of those who participated. It
might hide the vision and obstruct the breathing, but
the men who were to fight at Fleetwood were to take
no heed of weather or atmospheres. It was to be a
complete triumph over all that nature could offer to
impede, and a fight with an almost supernatural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</span>
fierceness that was apparently to be something more
than human.</p>

<p>With the dawn General Gregg, with Duffie, crossed
at Kelley’s Ford. Gregg traveled with Duffie to Stevensburg
and then turned north toward Brandy
Station. Duffie went on farther and passed by Stevensburg,
and then turned north to Brandy Station; and
Pleasanton crossed at Beverly’s Ford, and he headed
his columns toward Fleetwood Hill, around which
were to be woven wreaths of glory for the men on both
sides who here went to battle.</p>

<p>Stuart himself on the night of the 8th camped at
Fleetwood Hill. This position commanded a view of
the entire country with the exception of immediately
westward, which was known as the Barbour place,
which was a little higher than Fleetwood Hill.</p>

<p>Telepathy, which frequently pervades the movements
of armies, spoke to the Confederates. Their
slumbers were disquieted and they breathed in the
air that something important was close at hand.
Stuart and none of his men knew, for his scouts had
not found it out, that less than four miles away, indeed,
in some places less than one mile away, there were
thousands of Federal cavalry ready to dispute the question
of supremacy. General Stuart was himself a mile
in the rear of his forces, which were at St. James
Church, a third of the way between Fleetwood Hill and
Beverly’s Ford, on the road which ran from Beverly’s
Ford, and which led along the north bank to Duffin’s
Run.</p>

<p>Pleasanton had crossed the Rappahannock in the
early morning and was starting on an expedition to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</span>
break up Confederate communications and find out
where all the Confederates were. With twenty thousand
horsemen equally matched and in such close
proximity, all on the alert, battle could not be long
postponed. General Hooker had suspected a forward
movement of General Lee’s army. General Pleasanton
had behind him Russell’s and Ames’ brigades of infantrymen,
and with real military skill had managed to
conceal his presence from his enemies, and the Confederates
were surprised when, at the dawn of day, Colonel
Davis of the 8th New York Cavalry passed the Rappahannock
at Beverly’s Ford. The Federals had begun
operations very early, even before light. A company
of the 6th Virginia Cavalry was ready to dispute the
passage of the river and these Virginians, under command
of Captain Gibson, persistently and skillfully
delayed the advance of the Federal forces. The pickets
contested every inch of ground, and for half a mile
Davis’ brigade was fighting its way—still pressing
forward—and its men realized before the sun had
gotten up that the day’s work would be serious. After
Davis and his New York regiment had traveled half
a mile, Major Flournoy, who commanded the 6th
Virginia Cavalry, collected one hundred men. It
was barely light, but he went after the 8th New York
with vigor. A third of the Confederates were either
killed or wounded, but they were not without recompense.
Colonel Davis was killed in the fight. Amongst
those in the Confederate charge was Lieutenant R. O.
Allen, of Company D, 6th Virginia Cavalry. In the
movement under Flournoy, his horse was wounded and
this induced him to remain in the woods. Observing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</span>
Federal officer in the road, about two hundred feet in
front of his column, Lieutenant Allen advanced upon
him. The Federal commander’s attention was given
to his men, and with his sword he was waving them
forward. Allen was upon him before he realized the
situation, and when Colonel Davis turned his head, he
assaulted Allen with his sabre. The fearless Virginian
had only one shot in his pistol; he was taking large
risks. He reserved his single shot for the crucial moment,
and swinging himself upon the side of his horse,
he avoided the sword stroke of the Federal; and arising
in his saddle, he fired the one shot which he had reserved
for the emergency, and the Federal colonel fell
dead.</p>

<p>Both Federals and Confederates advanced to the
scene of this tragic conflict. Losses were suffered on
both sides. The Confederate lieutenant hastily returned
to his lines. The firing attracted the attention
of General Jones, who promptly ordered up the 7th
Virginia Cavalry. The men had been gathered in such
haste that a number of them were coatless, and some of
them had pressed forward with such impatience that
they had not taken time to saddle their beasts. The
7th Virginia charged fiercely, but the Federals met the
charge with such courage that the Virginians were
forced back and they passed two guns, of Hart’s
Battery, stationed in the road.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the artillery on both sides
had given a wonderful account of themselves. The
7th Virginia Cavalry, many without their saddles,
had rushed to stay the tide of Federal advance
from Beverly’s Ford. These, by sheer force of numbers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</span>
were swept away, leaving the two guns of
Hart’s Confederate Battery unprotected. The Federals,
animated by their success in scattering the
cavalry, believed they would find these guns an easy
prey, but the gunners were in no mood to yield their
pieces or to run away from their speechless companions,
who, with them, had so firmly stood in battle array
for many months. They had learned to love the iron
and steel, cold and emotionless though it was, and the
thought of these long-time friends passing into the
possession and use of their enemies gave them keenest
pangs of regret. Supports or no supports, they resolved
to fight out the right of ownership, and come what
might, to stand or fall by their beloved guns. They saw
the advancing foe. The vibration caused by the tramp
of the rushing squadrons could be felt, and to escape
from capture or death seemed hopeless. Once determined
at all hazards to protect their cannon, all questions
of escape were dismissed and all fears banished.
With haste quickened by danger, they fired shot after
shot into the advancing columns of the assailants.
Shells were discarded and the deadlier canister pushed
into the pieces, now warm by rapid firing, was sent
crashing into the front ranks of the foe. These dauntless
files went down before the withering currents of death
that were starting every moment from the two guns,
and when at last they reached the pieces, their ranks
were shattered and their columns broken. Slowly the
brave men by hand moved their guns to places of
safety, and at length they found shelter behind the
ranks of the forces disposed around the little country
church, and about which for five hours the storm of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</span>
battle had been raging with intense fierceness. The
men who had stood for these guns had risked much and
dared everything without counting cost, and as they
rolled their guns and caissons into the Confederate
ranks, so gladly opened to receive them, their comrades
greeted them with shouts of admiration and approval.
They had accomplished more than they had even hoped.
They had caught the contagion of intrepidity that was
in the air on that day. The conduct of the men on both
sides was such as to stir the hearts of brave people
everywhere in the world and to win for the American
volunteer soldier immortal acclaim.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock the din and turmoil had become
appalling. Both sides had changed positions, but
fought with a courage like to that born of despair.
Wherever the men in gray found mounted or unmounted
bluecoats they rode at them with furious savagery, and
likewise the men in blue seemed to rise out of the earth
fully armed and pressed on to unrelenting conflict.</p>

<p>Some Confederate guns near St. James Church were
especially destructive and annoying to the 6th Pennsylvania
Cavalry and a regiment of United States
regulars. Their officers concluded that the quickest
and most effective way to get rid of this battery was
to ride it down. The cavalry was twenty-four hundred
feet from the annoying artillery, and the way led across
an open space. The bugles were sounded, the guidons
were lifted and the order to charge stirred the souls of
these brave soldiers. Aligning themselves, they burst
into the open space like a devastating cyclone. The
earth trembled beneath the tread of the galloping
steeds. They were riding, many of them, to death,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</span>
but death in the excitement of the moment lost all its
terrors, and madly they rode forward. There was no
organized force in front of this magnificent column to
oppose the ride. The guns were to the front and stood
out boldly in the perspective. The men at the guns
knew well their duty and understood the call. Not a
man flinched. The horses were behind, but the cannoneers
had no use for horses now. Something like
five minutes was necessary to reach the battery. Every
man, with quickened movements, prepared to fight to
the death and to drive, with promptness and despatch,
grape and canister into the ranks of the approaching
Federals. The men in blue looked ahead; they saw
the gunners with nimble movements loading and ramming
the missiles. These they knew must soon send
havoc into their ranks, but not a man swayed from his
place in the line where duty bade him ride. Starting
with victorious cries, they galloped to the muzzles of
the thundering guns. They rode over the pieces, they
sabred the gunners who did not dodge under the wheels
and limber chests. They could not stop. The gait
was too rapid to rein up at the guns; they dashed
around and over them. If a man in gray showed himself,
the swish of a sabre drove him to cover. Now,
beyond the guns, they saw moving, charging men.
The Federals had cut in between Hampton’s and
Jones’ brigades, and the moment of reparation had
arrived. Hampton and Jones ordered an assault upon
these intrepid assailants. Orders rang out shrill and
clear. The gunners who for a moment had disappeared
under the wheels and chests sprang up and began to
push more grape and canister into the throats of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</span>
cannon. They hurled their guns about, stood at their
appointed stations ready to turn the storm loose once
more against these brave men in blue, who, though
balked in their work, had no mind to give up the contest.</p>

<p>With the Federal lines a little scattered, Hampton
and Jones rushed down with impetuous fury and the
Federals were glad to ride away and escape from the
onslaught of these numerous, new-found foes. The
guns were saved, but as if by fire; and the artillery at
Fleetwood had won, if it were possible, greater fame
for the horse artillery of the Army of Northern Virginia.</p>

<p>The morning was well advanced when a single
horseman from one of Robertson’s North Carolina
regiments, riding with the swiftness of the wind,
advised General Stuart that the Federals were advancing
from Kelley’s Ford, that they were now at Brandy
Station, and were immediately in the rear of the Confederate
line. This looked like a bad mix-up all round.
The Federals were in the rear of the Confederates and
the Confederates were in the rear of the Federals, and
nobody seemed to know exactly where the other body
was.</p>

<p>When this startling announcement was made, which
appeared so unreasonable to General Stuart, because he
did not know the man personally, he directed the scout
to return and satisfy himself by closest inspection if it
could be possible that the troops in the rear were
Federal forces. In five minutes the man returned and
with confidence pointed General Stuart to the Federal
lines, then within less than half a mile of Fleetwood Hill;
and there, sure enough, General Stuart saw a long column
of the enemy passing. They were the men that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</span>
had gone under Gregg and Duffie, down by Stevensburg,
and had changed their front. They had sought
and found their foes. These Federals were facing
toward Brandy Station. It was apparent that in a few
minutes this place would be captured, and half a mile
away was Fleetwood Hill, and this was the key to the
situation.</p>

<p>General Stuart, great commander though he was,
now faced difficult and perplexing problems that might
have embarrassed a man less experienced and less great.</p>

<p>A single gun of Chew’s Battery, because of its
exhausted ammunition, had been abandoned on the
side of the hill. Some imperfect shells and some shot
had been left over in the limber chest and this one single
gun was pulled up on the hill and was opened upon the
advancing Federals. A courier in great haste was dispatched
to General Stuart to tell him of the gravity
of the situation. Only three Confederates were there,
and they saw that if the Federals once gained Fleetwood
Hill and were enabled to plant their artillery on its
heights that it must be recovered or the day was lost.
General Gregg and General Buford were advancing
up the hill, and expected to take it without any fight.
They were surprised to find artillery there. They had
intended to attack General Stuart in the rear, where they
believed there was no protection, and the stubborn
defense with this gun amazed and puzzled the Federal
commander. He did not know that on the hill there
was only one gun and three men; one of these was
Major McClellan, Stuart’s adjutant general. It would
not have taken long for a charging squad to have gotten
control of this important post.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</span></p>

<p>General Gregg, deceived by this stout resistance,
prepared to meet artillery with artillery, and he lost
some time in unlimbering the three guns he had with
him, and as soon as possible they opened vigorously
upon the gun and three men who were defending
Fleetwood.</p>

<p>To the first courier General Stuart had been incredulous;
when the second came, the sound of the
Federal cannonading announced unmistakably that
the report was true. The Confederates, had nothing
closer to Fleetwood Hill than the 12th Virginia under
Colonel Harman, and a few men under Colonel White.
Major McClellan had done all he could to get orders
carried to General Stuart. To get the orders delivered
and have reinforcements returned seemed many hours
to him and his two companions, now maintaining a
place, the retaking of which was necessary to win the
battle, and if retaken would cost many lives. Riding
in hot haste, with lines broken, Colonel Harman was
the first to reach the scene of danger. As he rode up,
Major McClellan urged upon Colonel Harman the
emergency of the situation. He gave him no time to
form his regiment, but ordered him to go in pell mell.
Harman was brave and enterprising and he obeyed his
orders and rode at full speed to the top of the hill, as
the brave cannoneers were retiring, after firing their
last cartridge from the lone gun that was standing off
Gregg and his men.</p>

<p>One hundred and fifty feet away the 1st New Jersey
Cavalry, under Colonel Windom, was advancing in
columns of squadrons, with banners flying and sabres
drawn. Colonel Harman’s followers of the 12th Virginia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</span>
had reached the top of the hill at this critical
moment, but in columns of fours it went north westwardly
of the summit. The men behind their intrepid
colonel rode hard to follow him and save the situation.
Harman, realizing that instantaneous action was necessary,
took the men he had and directed the artillery
at the Federals. General Stuart, now alive to the exigencies
of the situation, had ordered General Hampton
and General Jones to leave the position at St. James
Church and concentrate on Fleetwood Hill.</p>

<p>Hampton himself was a good soldier, and he had the
perception of a sagacious leader, and when he heard
firing he realized the danger and he had already
commenced withdrawing his forces to meet the new
situation.</p>

<p>The 12th Virginia under Harman, always gallant,
at this time seemed to have failed by reason of their
inability to get into line in time to make the charge.
Harman notified Colonel M. C. Butler, of the South
Carolina Legion, that he must look out for enemies that
were in the rear, and now the Confederates set about
the task of holding Fleetwood Hill, the center of this
great cavalry fight. All the regiments of Jones’ brigade
and Hampton’s brigade participated in charges and
counter charges, and both sides had now reached the
top of the eminence. The 1st New Jersey Cavalry had
temporary possession of the hill. Harman and White
had failed in the first attempt to prevent the 1st New
Jersey from this movement. Harman now re-formed
his regiment and went on furiously to avenge his former
failure. Half way up the hill the gallant Confederate
colonel was wounded in an encounter with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</span>
Federal commander. Colonel White re-formed his
squadrons. He charged along the west side of the hill
and attacked the three guns which General Gregg
unlimbered and with which he had opened a fierce
fire. He drove the Federal cavalry away from the
guns, but the gunners of the 6th New York Battery,
though the cavalry left them, were not disposed to
give up their pieces. Of the thirty-six men, thirty were
killed or wounded. All were killed or wounded beside
their guns. The Confederates took possession of the
pieces, but this was only after a resistance and valor
that made this Federal battery famous for all time to
come. The possession of these pieces, however, was
not to remain long with the Confederates. The captors
were quickly surrounded with superior numbers, and
the Confederate commander was compelled to cut his
way out with heavy loss. He was glad to get away with
even a remnant of his brave followers.</p>

<p>Hampton, Jones, Robertson were all now converging
upon Fleetwood Hill. No sooner had Flournoy,
who had already been seriously battered, arrived with
the 6th Virginia Cavalry than he was ordered by General
Stuart to charge the Federals on the right flank,
which was to the east and south of Fleetwood Hill.
The decimation of the day had reduced Flournoy’s
regiment to two hundred men. Disparity of numbers
had no terrors for these brave riders. They forced
the lines of the enemy and attacked and captured their
battery, but they were unable to hold it, as more than
one thousand Federals attacked this regiment in the
rear. But the scenes, like a kaleidoscope, were changing.
Every turn of the wheel seemed to make new
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</span>combinations. In the midst of this confusion and uncertainty
General Wade Hampton appeared upon the
scene. He entered upon their view at a gallop. As he
approached Fleetwood Hill he saw the plateau covered
with Federal cavalry. There was nothing to do but
fight it out and so General Hampton ordered a charge
of his columns.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/p597.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">MAP OF BATTLEFIELD OF FLEETWOOD HILL</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This field was now to witness one of the most
thrilling and stirring incidents of the entire war. By
the commands on either side, two brigades of horsemen
in column were to make an attempt to ride each other
down. Such scenes with small numbers had occurred
many times, but now it was to be tried out on a larger
scale. Nearly evenly matched, the contest was to put
to severest strain the valor and the grit of all who should
enter the arena.</p>

<p>Neither dared await the shock that the charge of
the other would bring. Motion, rapid motion alone
would counteract the impact from either side. To stand
still meant to be overwhelmed. To ride meant overturning,
mayhap going down under a great crash, and
possibly, if the sword and bullets should be escaped,
then mangling or death beneath the bodies or hoofs
of the maddened or injured horses.</p>

<p>The spirit of the hour was doing and daring. The
leaders thought quickly and acted promptly. The day
was well advanced when this event occurred.</p>

<p>Fifteen hundred horses would weigh one million,
six hundred and fifty thousand pounds; fifteen hundred
men would weigh two hundred and forty thousand
pounds, an aggregate of one million, eight hundred and
ninety thousand pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</span></p>

<p>One million, eight hundred and ninety thousand
pounds of flesh and blood to rush at the rate of seven
feet per second against a moving wall of like weight
and material meant woe, ruin, desolation. It did not
require long to cover the intervening space. Each
side moved toward the other with grim determination,
and two bodies thus in motion were to clash in a brief
interval.</p>

<p>The men were enthused by the cries of “Charge!
Charge! Charge!” and the excitement and exhilaration
of battle and struggle made every heart fearless, defiant
and reckless. They plunged their spurs into the sides
of their steeds. Some drew their sabres, others their
revolvers. The men spurring, shouting, yelling, by
their enthusiasm, excited and aroused the dumb
brutes, who seemed to feel the energy of combat.
Racing at their highest speed, with mouths open and
distended nostrils, madly and furiously they galloped
to the onset.</p>

<p>Horses and men alike seemed to catch the animation
of great deeds, and, as if in sympathy with each
other, men and beasts together were willingly rushing
onward to make destruction and wreck. Not a single
man hesitated. Here and there a horse fell and his
master went down to earth, but not one turned aside
from the path of jeopardy and peril. The surging
crowd, from both directions, was now, at highest
speed, pushing relentlessly forward to overwhelm their
foes. The beasts seemed almost human in the exhilaration
and dash of the rapid charge, and appeared to
apprehend the call that was being made upon their
spirit and powers. Neither side took time to count<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</span>
the cost or figure the result. If either rode away or
hesitated, they felt that the last state of that soldier
would be worse than the first. There was nothing left
but to fight out the issues that war at this moment had
thus joined. Its terrors, if they reasoned, would overwhelm
reason. Three minutes was all the time that
was allowed to calculate before the awful shock would
come. The crash would be bad enough, but on the
eve of this, the deadly sabre loomed up before the eyes
of the actors, the flash of the revolver and then the
crush and down-going of stricken, maimed, dead brutes,
and with them broken limbs and maimed bodies of the
daring riders stood, if only for an instant, before the
vision.</p>

<p>The fearful onset speedily came. Some horses
passed their heads by, but this meant the lifting of the
riders from their saddles to take their chances in the
crush below. Horses’ heads met horses’ heads, and these
sprang high into the air, and then fell in a heap on the
ground. Others by the tremendous shock were killed
and lay gasping in agony. Some swept by only to be
turned about and anew to dash at their opposers.
Of the men, some already pale in death lay beneath
the bodies of their gasping steeds. Others, with glistening
sabres, were cutting and slashing those who fell or
lay by their side, or stood in their front. Again,
others with their revolvers or carbines were firing at
their foes and with savage determination fought without
mercy or pity.</p>

<p>A dense cloud of dust rose from the spot where the
struggling men and beasts had met. The smoke of
firearms shut out the light of day. Amid these scenes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</span>
of horror, darkness and suffering, men fought to the
death. In a little while, from the dust and smoke,
with blackened and stained faces the fighters began to
rise. Those who had escaped returned to help those
who had fallen. The passions of war seemed for a brief
while satiated. The men in blue singly and in squads,
glad to be relieved from the horrible surroundings,
some walking and some riding, turned their faces
from the fearful scenes of ruin and disaster that loomed
up in ghastly horror before their eyes. They realized
that the men in gray had vanquished them, and without
a stain on their valor and courage, they marched away
to cross the river they had forded at the coming of the
dawn, with highest hopes and grandest expectations
of victory.</p>

<p>Over toward the west was a part of the 1st New Jersey
Cavalry. They had fought much during the day
and they had fought well, but they were not dispirited
and they were ready to fight some more.
Young’s charge had cut them off from their comrades.
They examined the field and saw that they must either
surrender or cut their way through the Confederate
lines. The Confederate guns were on a narrow ridge.
To gain their friends, these New Jersey men must pass
through or over these batteries. These Federal horsemen
were too brave to hesitate at any danger, however
appalling. What was to be done must be done quickly.
Delay only increased danger and risks. The coward
dies a thousand deaths, the brave man dies but one,
and animated by the loftiest impulses of courage, they
resolved to take the one chance, and if need be to face
the iron storm they well knew must burst upon them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</span>
if they made gallant attempt to ride down their foes.
The bugle blast ended all questionings, and forward
they galloped to meet whatever the moment should
bring.</p>

<p>The artillerymen looked and saw a new danger
looming up on the horizon. With the speed of the wind
the men in blue were riding down upon them. The
pieces were quickly changed to meet this advancing
foe. At this critical moment there were no Confederate
horsemen to help defend or support the guns. The
brave artillerists, spurred to sublime valor by the exigencies
of the supreme test, resolved to defend their
holdings or die with their pieces.</p>

<p>The blue-clad assailants came dashing upon the
flank of the batteries. In a moment the guns were
turned and hurling defiance and destruction in the face
of the foes. They unhorsed and destroyed some, but
they could not destroy all, and a remnant rushed in
upon the nervy gunners who awaited the crash. It
was a hand-to-hand fight between the men on horseback
and the men on the cannons and on the ground. The
Federal colonel fell at the side of a caisson. Another
gunner fired a pistol ball into the heart of the Federal
major. These died gloriously, but they died in vain.
The charge failed. The enemy retreated and glory
crowned the brave artillerists with new laurels. They
were alone, but their name was legion, and they fought
with fury and with success. The Confederates held
the coveted hill. Gregg had made a great fight. He
and his men had lost, but they had won for Federal
cavalry great honor and had shown a valor that was
worthy of any cause, and which entitled them to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</span>
praise of their people and their country. From the
south, toward Culpepper Court House, clouds of dust
now rose on the horizon. Long lines of Confederate
infantry were seen advancing. They had come to help
their cavalry comrades, but their coming so long delayed
was of no avail. The horsemen, without help,
had driven back their foes and these were now recrossing
the Rappahannock, over which at dawn they had
passed with sure and expectant hopes of a speedy and
great victory.</p>

<p>Two men, who fell on the Confederate side, proved
a great loss. Colonel Sol Williams, of the 2d North
Carolina Cavalry, active, brave and gallant, observing
that his regiment was inactive for a brief while, volunteering
to ride with the charging column, went down
at the front. His death was a great loss to his country
and to the cavalry service.</p>

<p>Colonel Frank Hampton, younger brother of General
Wade Hampton, discerning an emergency, placed
himself at the head of a small squad, and charged a
Federal column to delay its advance until other troops
could be brought to resist it. With hardly one to fifteen
of the foe, he assaulted the Federal column with
fiercest vigor. His small company responded to duty’s
call, but it was a forlorn hope. They died as brave
men are ever ready to die for the cause they love.
Colonel Hampton fell, mortally wounded, but he fell
where all the Hamptons were wont to fall—at the front.</p>

<p>The Federal cavalry lost the field. They left some
guns in possession of their foes, many banners, hundreds
of prisoners and numerous dead. They hesitated
long about leaving these things behind them, and a real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</span>
grief filled their hearts at the thought that, after a day
of so much daring and such brilliant achievement,
they must recede before their foes and desert their
wounded—remit them to the care and mercy of their
enemies, and their dead to sepulture by the hands of
those they had so valiantly fought.</p>

<p>These memories were depressing, but notwithstanding
these sad recollections, they carried some splendid
assurances from the field of carnage and ruin. They
had met in an open field the best troopers the army of
General Lee could send to conflict. Against these brave
and experienced riders of the Confederates they had
held their own, and for fourteen hours they had fought
with a courage and an intrepidity that not even the
Confederate legions could surpass. They had demonstrated
that the Federal cavalry, when the conditions
were equal, was not inferior to the men who rode with
Stuart, and who had rendered his name and theirs
illustrious. This new-found realization of power and
courage gave Federal cavalry a pervading consciousness
of their strength as warriors, and created in their
minds and hearts a quickened courage that would bear
them up and make them more fearless and efficient
in the service their country would expect from them,
in the twenty-two months that yet remained before the
end would come, and Lee and his legions be compelled
by the decrees of a pitiless fate to ground their arms
and acknowledge Federal supremacy.</p>

GENERAL J. E. B. STUART’S CHAMBERSBURG<br>
RAID, OCTOBER 9, 1862</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">On the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th of October, 1862,
General J. E. B. Stuart performed his most
brilliant military feat in the raid on Chambersburg,
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Fording the Potomac on the morning of the 10th,
at early dawn, he proceeded to Mercersburg and thence
to Chambersburg. The crossing of the river had been
skilfully and bravely done, and the march of forty miles
to Chambersburg was no mean task in the fifteen hours
which had elapsed since morn. Fair weather marked
the day’s ride, and at 9 o’clock at night the brilliant
cavalry soldier of the Army of Northern Virginia housed
himself and men in the quiet and quaint old town,
well up in the boundaries of the Quaker State.</p>

<p>It was a new experience for the loyal men of the
North to find the hungry Confederate raiders in their
very midst and feeding themselves in their pantries
and their horses at their granaries.</p>

<p>But the romance of the raid was to end here.</p>

<p>The Potomac, never very sure in its movements,
might rise, and Stuart must then return some other
way than the one he came. The splashing of the rain,
relentless and constant, during the night, and the pattering
of great drops as they drove against the window
panes, awakened in his bosom the most harassing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</span>uncertainty; and throughout the long and (to him)
almost endless hours of darkness, came the harrowing
thought that the streams fed by the torrents now falling
would swell the Potomac and thus cut off all possibility
of escape for his command.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp66" id="p607" style="max-width: 55.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p607.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">GENERAL J. E. B. STUART</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>His aides and guides, less troubled with responsibility,
assured him that his fleet troopers would outride
the currents that flowed toward the ocean; but the
danger and the trials of the coming day and night rose
up in the heart of the dashing commander and disturbed
the quiet of his gay and chivalrous soul.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 11th he began his homeward
march. Eighty miles from the boundary, where he
might pass it, far into an unfriendly country, every resource
of which was now placed under contribution to
effect his capture or the destruction of his force, and
with thousands of troops, both mounted and unmounted,
converging to the points where he must pass,
rendered his situation acutely desperate and such as to
cause keenest apprehension and profoundest fear.</p>

<p>But with Stuart rode officers and men who never
quailed. Hampton, Lee, Butler, Robertson, Jones and
Pelham, and 1,800 men, the pick of Virginia, Maryland
and the Carolinas, were in the saddle with
him, and there was no foe they feared and none who
could whip them except by brute force and superior
numbers.</p>

<p>Forth from Chambersburg this splendid division
began the march homeward. Twelve hundred horses,
the fruits of impressment, made up a part of the train—for
already the Confederacy felt the need of stable
recruiting—no stragglers nor laggards. A great work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</span>
was ahead of a great command, and no heart felt
solicitude at any fate which awaited.</p>

<p>All day long the steady trot of the troopers was kept
up, and when the sun began to hide its face behind the
Alleghanies the cavalcade had been less than half the
distance required of it for safety and rest. A few
minutes’ halt was all that could be allowed. The
troopers dismount and shake themselves; the wearied
horses munch a little feed, and the bugle-call again
commands to saddle.</p>

<p>Thirty-one and a half miles since morn, and yet
thirty-three and a half more before dawn.</p>

<p>The knightly Pelham, later to shed his blood, rode
all through the night with the advance, and close behind
the watchful commander and his escort.</p>

<p>A full day’s work already done, but a fuller night’s
work yet to be done.</p>

<p>Peremptory orders are transmitted to ride over
everything that opposes the march; and so, trot, trot,
trot, through the long hours of darkness, and the
wearied horsemen peer through the gloom, and in
silent and anxious wonder gaze at the spectres—the
creation of their fancy and imagination—which on
parallel lines ride by their side; and they scan the horizon
with anxious longing to catch the first appearance
of the much-desired dawn, which might relieve the
dismal and oppressive foreboding of the lengthened
night.</p>

<p>Sixty-five miles in twenty-four hours. No halt.
Still sixteen miles more.</p>

<p>Thousands of busy and eager enemies and uncalculated
dangers beset them. The bodies of these hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</span>
riders begin to feel the trying effects of the rapid march,
and nature raises a solemn protest against war’s demands
upon her children. But the order for the swinging
trot abates not, and man and beast, brightened by
the rising sun, are put under sterner tribute for stronger
effort.</p>

<p>Wearied marchers: the crisis is now at hand.</p>

<p>Stuart and his riders had vanquished nature:
Could they now vanquish man? If Stuart crossed the
Potomac to reach Chambersburg, he must recross it
to reach Virginia; and to prevent the latter, all the
skill, energy and genius of the Federal commanders
were called forth.</p>

<p>Pleasanton, who with Federal cavalry was hard
behind the Confederate raiders, had marched seventy-eight
miles in twenty-eight hours, but this wonderful
gait still left him in Stuart’s rear, and now that the
point at which Stuart was to cross was revealed, every
Federal soldier that could be reached was pressed forward
to dispute the passage. Whit’s Ford was guarded,
but not sufficiently well to impede the rush of the Confederates,
and the Federals at the crucial moment retired,
and the way was opened for the escape and safety
of the valiant Confederate corps.</p>

<p>Twenty-seven hours and eighty-one miles. No
sleep. No rest.</p>

<p>Galloping, fighting, scouting and ready to assail
any enemy, with human endurance tested to the
greatest possible limit—what think you, reader, of the
conduct of these riders, when, out of those three
brigades, only two men, either by sleep, illness, hunger,
weariness or straggling, were missing when, at noon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</span>
on the 12th of October, on Virginia’s soil, Stuart called
his roll to calculate losses?</p>

<p>Measured by any human formula for patience or
endurance, courage, loyalty and chivalry, this service
of Stuart and his command stands with but few parallels
in military history. They did all men could do,
and the Divine Judge himself requires nothing more
than this at man’s hands.</p>

GENERAL JOHN B. MARMADUKE’S “CAPE<br>
GIRARDEAU RAID,” APRIL, 1863</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">General John B. Marmaduke was a
thoroughly born and reared Southern man.
Descended from Virginia ancestry, he first saw
the light on March 14th, 1833, at Arrow Rock, Missouri.
Possessed of a splendid physique, with a common
school education, he entered Yale. He was there two
years and one year at Harvard, and then he was appointed
to the United States Military Academy from
whence he graduated when twenty-two years of age. As
a brevet second lieutenant he went with Albert Sidney
Johnston and aided in putting down the Mormon revolt
in 1858. He remained in the West for two years and
at the opening of the Civil War was stationed in New
Mexico. Fond of military life, it involved much sacrifice
for him to resign his commission in the United
States Army, but he did not hesitate an instant and
on the 17th of April, 1861, he severed his connection
with the regular army and at once raised a company
of Missouri State Guards. His West Point education
gave him prominence at once and he was made colonel
of a Missouri military organization. Brave and proud-spirited,
he disagreed with his uncle, Claiborne F.
Jackson, then governor of Missouri, and left the service
there and reported at Richmond, to the Confederate
government. He had five brothers in the Confederate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</span>
Army or Navy. His father, Meredith Miles Marmaduke,
was governor of Missouri in 1844.</p>

<p>With General Hardee, in Southeast Missouri, he
was made colonel of the 3d Confederate Infantry.
Crossing the river to aid General Albert Sidney Johnston
destroy Grant’s army, he participated in the Battle
of Shiloh, and was signally honored by his grateful
government for his splendid service and was made a
brigadier general while he was yet an inmate of the
hospital from wounds received on that field. There was
a great call at that time in the West for brave and experienced
men, and four months after the Battle of
Shiloh he was transferred to the trans-Mississippi
Department, and from August, 1862, to January, 1863,
he commanded the Confederate cavalry in Arkansas
and Missouri. Vigilant, active and enterprising, he
made a number of raids into Missouri. He was a fierce
fighter, and never hesitated to attack his enemy when
prudence justified an assault. Ordered to break Federal
communication between Springfield and Rolla, Missouri,
he inflicted great loss upon his enemies, but after
a most valiant attack, through the failure of some
of his troops to come on time, he was compelled to
withdraw and retreat. He held a conspicuous place
in the attack upon Helena, Arkansas, in July, 1863,
and was successful in capturing the Federal camps at
Pine Bluff. In the defense of Little Rock he played a
notable part and covered General Price’s retreat after
the evacuation of the capital of Arkansas.</p>

<p>He fought a duel with General Lucien M. Walker
which shadowed his life. Under the terms arranged by
the seconds, the two men were placed ten feet apart.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</span>
The weapons were revolvers, and they were to advance
and continue firing until the weapons were empty.
Walker was mortally wounded at the second shot.
Marmaduke was placed under arrest and relieved of
his command. The exigencies of the hour made his
services so important that he was permitted to resume
his command during the pending operations. He was
finally released by General Holmes. All through Missouri
and Arkansas and Louisiana he was in many
engagements, and for his magnificent service in 1864 in
delaying Steele and preventing his union with General
Banks, and for his valor in the Battle of Jenkins Ferry,
he was made a major general. He was with Price in his
ill-fated campaign in the fall of 1864. Dauntless and
gallant in the protection of Price’s rear, while making
vigorous battle he was captured near Fort Scott,
Kansas. He was carried to Fort Warren and remained
there until August, 1865, and when released went
abroad, but returned to engage in business in St. Louis.
For two years he was active in journalism. He served
as secretary of the Missouri Board of Agriculture, was
railroad commissioner four years, elected governor of
Missouri in 1884, in which office he died in his fifty-fourth
year, in Jefferson City, on December 24th,
1887.</p>

<p>Brave, of great resource, intensely loyal, few men of
the war had as many wide experiences. The South had
no more loyal son. His three and a half years of military
service were marked with incessant and constant
activities, and he had no rest, unless while in the hospital
recovering from wounds received in battle. Although
connected with the cavalry, in an engagement where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</span>
some Missouri infantry were falling back before a
sudden and terrific fire, General Marmaduke, with an
aide-de-camp, William Price, rode in among the hesitating
infantry, and violently taking from two standard
bearers their colors, rushed into the midst of these
troops and lifting the banners aloft pleaded with the
men to stand firm. His noble example restored order
to the line, and out of retreat they moved forward with
conspicuous gallantry, and won victory.</p>

<p>In March, 1863, General Holmes was relieved of the
command of the Trans-Mississippi Department, and
General E. Kirby Smith, who had made such a brilliant
reputation in the Kentucky campaign with the army of
Tennessee, was assigned to the full charge of the territory.
He established his headquarters at Shreveport,
Louisiana, and General Holmes was placed in command
of the district of Arkansas, which included Arkansas,
Indian Territory and the state of Missouri.</p>

<p>Early in April, 1863, General Price returned after
his service in the army of Tennessee and the Trans-Mississippi
Department, and was assigned to the
command of an infantry division. In the northern
part of Arkansas there was nothing except Marmaduke’s
division of cavalry, and this was in and around
Batesville. The Confederates were loth to abandon
the portion of Arkansas above the Arkansas River, and
endeavored to hold the enemy in check for eighty miles
north of that stream. The Confederates were not unaware
that a most determined effort would be made to
capture Little Rock. By the aid of the forces from
Memphis and up the Arkansas River and down through
Missouri, combinations were made which it was believed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</span>
would render it impossible for the Confederates
to hold that post.</p>

<p>The only really organized force operating in the
territory northwest of Arkansas was Marmaduke’s
cavalry division, composed of Shelby’s and Greene’s
brigades. Anxious to do something to relieve the
pressure upon Little Rock, General Marmaduke felt
that if he should march northeastwardly to Cape
Girardeau, Missouri, he might accomplish two things:
first, he might recruit quite a large number of troops.
Missouri was one of the best recruiting grounds for
the Confederate states. There was no time when an
organized force entered Missouri, when there was any
sort of opportunity for the young men, or even the
middle-aged men to enter the Confederate service that
hundreds of them did not rush to the Confederate
standard. Marmaduke, Shelby, Price and all those who
invaded Missouri were not only gratified but astonished
at the readiness with which recruits flocked to
join them.</p>

<p>General Marmaduke believed that he might stay
the approach of the Federals in their advance upon
Little Rock. General Holmes was so pleased with
Marmaduke’s offer to do something that he not only
approved but encouraged him, and ordered forward
to his support Carter’s brigade of Texas cavalry,
which was the possessor of a four-gun battery and
counted fifteen hundred men. The men of this brigade
were not experienced, but they had grit, endurance
and courage, and they were not long in measuring up
to the standard of veterans. This gave General Marmaduke
a force of nearly five thousand cavalry and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</span>
eight pieces of artillery, but nearly one-fourth of them
were unarmed and one-fifth dismounted. This was a
formidable array to turn loose either in the rear or in
the face of the enemy. It was more than Morgan ever
had under his command; it was more than General
Wheeler was ever able to take on a raid; and was greater
than General Forrest had hitherto been able to pull
together.</p>

<p>Marmaduke also learned that there was a Federal
officer at Bloomfield, five miles south of Cape Girardeau,
who had become infamous in the eyes of the Confederates,
and of all the men in the Federal Army the
Missouri troops would rather have captured General
John McNeil. He was known amongst the men of the
South as “the butcher.” This came from his brutality
to prisoners and citizens, and he was the most hated
man in the Federal Armies west of the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>The season of the year was fairly propitious for
cavalry marches. The country was denuded of corn
and oats, but green stuff was abundant and the grasses
which grew with such luxuriousness in that section
furnished bountiful feed, such as it was, for the horses.
The scarcity of grain made raiding difficult unless grass
was growing. Colonel John F. Phillips, commanding a
Federal Missouri cavalry regiment, on July 30th, 1863,
wrote of this section: “There is nothing to eat in this
country. It is the impersonation of poverty and
desolation.”</p>

<p>From Batesville, Arkansas, to Cape Girardeau was
about one hundred and eighty miles. Marmaduke had
learned that McNeil had been ordered to march northward
from Bloomfield, Missouri, toward Pilot Knob.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</span>
This would be a distance of seventy miles. Marmaduke
reasoned correctly that McNeil would obey orders,
and so he sent a force toward Bloomfield to stir up
McNeil, hoping that he would follow the directions
of his superiors and march toward Pilot Knob. Frederickstown
was ten miles southeast of Pilot Knob, and
here Marmaduke purposed to intercept McNeil, and
with Carter behind him and Shelby in front of him, it
was calculated that short work would be made of
McNeil’s two thousand infantry.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the march there was warm work
at Patterson, a small town fifty miles from the Arkansas
line. At this point a Missouri Federal militia regiment,
under Colonel Smart, and several Home Guard companies
had been stationed for quite a while. One of
the most offensive of these Home Guard companies
was commanded by Captain Leper. Neither Leper
nor Smart stood well with the Confederates. They had
been aggressive, cruel and malignant, and General
Marmaduke had particular reasons for capturing both
Leper and Smart. The presence of the Confederates
had not been known fully to Smart and his associates,
and General Marmaduke had made disposition of his
forces to surround Patterson and its garrison, which he
intended to capture at any cost. With his eight pieces
of artillery he felt sure that within a reasonable time
he could batter down the fortifications. Shelby was
ordered to swing to the east, and a Texas regiment
was to move west; the Texas forces were to go east of
the place and close in from that direction, while Shelby
came from the other side. The Missourians caught
all the pickets, and without alarm were ready to assault<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</span>
the garrison. The officers in charge of the Texas brigade
were not familiar with the Missouri tactics. Instead
of capturing the pickets, they undertook to fight them
and used the artillery and opened a vigorous fire upon
these isolated videttes. Colonel Smart had been insistent
that there was nothing but a few militia in
proximity to Patterson, but when he heard the sound
of the artillery, he realized that heavy forces were about
to encircle him, and he speedily and hastily fled. A
small part of the garrison was captured. The men the
Confederates wanted, Smart and Leper, escaped.
These fired the houses containing the supplies, and a
large part of the town was burned. Later this was
charged to the Confederates, and after the war suits
were brought against quite a number of Confederate
officers to make them responsible for the destruction
of the town. This was annoying, but it was not effective.
The escape of the hated men quickened desire
to bag General McNeil.</p>

<p>A short while after this campaign McNeil still
further increased his reputation for bloodthirstiness.
A Federal spy was captured and disappeared near
Palmyra.</p>

<p>Major J. N. Edwards in his splendid work, “Shelby
and his Men,” gives the following account of this
terrible incident:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Colonel Porter captured Palmyra late in the fall of 1863,
and during his occupation of the town, one Andrew Allsman,
an ex-soldier of the 3d Missouri Federal Cavalry, and a spy,
informer, guide, traitor and scoundrel generally, was spirited
away, no one ever knew how or where. McNeil re-entered
Palmyra upon its evacuation by Colonel Porter, confined
ten worthy and good men captured from Porter’s command,
issued a notice to Porter dated October 8th, informing him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</span>
that unless Allsman was returned within ten days from the
date thereof, the prisoners then in his possession should be
executed. W. R. Strachan was the provost marshal, and
was just as cruel and just as bloodthirsty as his master.
Allsman was not returned—indeed, Porter never saw this
notice until the men were shot—and even had it been placed
before him, the rendition of Allsman was an impossibility,
for he knew nothing whatever of the men required to be
produced. Deaf to all petitions, steeled against every prayer
for mercy, eager and swift to act, McNeil ordered the execution
at the end of the appointed time. Ten brave, good men—Willis
Baker, Thomas Humston, Morgan Bixler, John Y.
McPheeters, Herbert Hudson, Captain Thomas A. Snider,
Eleazer Lake and Hiram Smith—were led out for the death
shots. Fearless, proud and noble in their bearing, these
innocent and excellent soldiers were sacrificed to the whim
of a butcher, and to satisfy the cravings of a foreign and brutal
soldiery. They met death without a shudder, willing to
yield upon their country’s altar the lives that had been devoted
to her service. A young Spartan—one of the abovementioned
men—volunteered to take the place of an old man
whose family was large and helpless, was accepted, and
untouched by the heroism of the boy, and indifferent to one
of the finest exhibitions of chivalry upon record, McNeil
and Strachan ordered his execution with the rest, thus covering
their names with everlasting infamy.</p>
</div>

<p>Colonel Carter, of Texas, commanding the brigade
called by his name, ambitious for distinction, solicited
the leadership of the force which was to attack McNeil,
and drive him either to follow the line of his orders or
force him to Cape Girardeau. He was specially directed
under no circumstances to follow McNeil into Cape
Girardeau. That post was strongly fortified and was
considered a position of great value on the Mississippi
River. Carter was given a force equal to that of McNeil,
so that there would be no question of McNeil’s discomfiture
if he disputed Carter’s right of way. The
men who fought in Missouri and Arkansas never hesitated
about results if it was man to man. McNeil’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</span>
courage had been hampered by a knowledge of the fact
that the Missouri troops had declared if he was ever
taken they would put him to death. His persecutions
and atrocities had rendered him so odious that nothing
could stay the vengeful resolves which filled the hearts
of the Missouri and Arkansas Confederates. Carter
had orders if McNeil went to Cape Girardeau to rejoin
Marmaduke. Marmaduke with Shelby’s brigade and
half of Greene’s reached Frederickstown, and there
waited for a sight of McNeil or for a report from Carter.
Neither came. Quickly marching his command to
Jackson, half way between Frederickstown and Cape
Girardeau, General Marmaduke there learned that
McNeil had hastened to Cape Girardeau; that Carter,
pursuing him, had become so enthused that he had
lost sight of his positive orders from Marmaduke and
had followed McNeil up to and partially into the
fortifications of Cape Girardeau. McNeil’s reinforcing
the garrison rendered the Federal forces at the Cape
impregnable. McNeil was inside the fortification and
Carter was outside and he was afraid to go away lest
the Federals should rush out and destroy him. Shelby
was immediately despatched to extricate Carter from
his embarrassing situation. In order to do this, it
was necessary to attack the fortification, which Shelby
promptly did, and lost forty-five men, killed and
wounded, among them some of the very best in his
brigade. Some were so seriously wounded that it
was impossible to remove them, and they were left in
charge of a surgeon, amongst their enemies. In those
days of intense bitterness and malignity, this was
barely preferable to death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</span></p>

<p>These four days lost meant much to General Marmaduke.
The exuberant zeal of one of Carter’s colonels,
coupled with his courage, had changed the Confederate
plan and destroyed its successful accomplishment,
and seriously affected the ultimate safety of Marmaduke’s
whole division. It was only thirty miles from
Cairo to Bloomfield, and from New Madrid, Missouri,
to Bloomfield, Marmaduke must almost of necessity
pass this point, and this rendered the Confederate Army
assailable both in its front and in its rear.</p>

<p>Marmaduke, north of Cape Girardeau, started his
army south on the 27th of April. General Vandever
was north of Marmaduke, and McNeil was south of
him. McNeil, who had one day’s start and the shortest
road to travel, could easily have intercepted Marmaduke
and blocked his way of escape. Marmaduke, of
course, might have ridden around him, and doubtless
would have attempted to do this, but this was hazardous.
McNeil became intimidated by the fear that he
might be captured, and that, he well understood, meant
direful consequences, and instead of pursuing the shorter
road, it was charged that he intentionally took the
longer one and let Marmaduke pass the critical point
unopposed. This put the entire Federal force behind
the Confederates, where it had no chance either greatly
to disturb or arrest their march, unless the swelling
currents of the St. Francis River might hold them in
check until the Federal pursuers could, through such
barrier, reach and overwhelm them.</p>

<p>General Curtis, from St. Louis, sent reinforcements
to Cape Girardeau, and he had ordered from Columbus,
Kentucky, several regiments through New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</span>
Madrid, Missouri, to prevent or embarrass the escape
of Marmaduke.</p>

<p>McNeil, on the 26th of April, telegraphed from Cape
Girardeau that he was attacked by eight thousand men
under Marmaduke.</p>

<p>General William Vandever, on April 29th, 1863,
six miles from Bloomfield, Missouri, speaking of Marmaduke,
said: “I think we have run him harder than
he has ever run before.”</p>

<p>Of the men who went with Marmaduke, as before
stated, twelve hundred were unmounted and nine
hundred unarmed. Some of the men had Enfield
rifles, some Mississippi and squirrel rifles. Practically
no captures had been made, and the opportunities for
securing mounts in this already war-cursed country
were very slim. The unmounted men, with hope
stirring their hearts, half running, half walking, kept
up with their more fortunate comrades who had started
with beasts that could at least go a part of the way.
If any of these walking troopers picked up a mount, it
was the occasion for special thanks to the God of war.
In the beginning General Marmaduke divided his
forces over large territory and scattered them, to create
the impression that he was moving northwardly instead
of northeastwardly. He trusted in this way to
throw his enemies off their guard. This would enable
him to surprise, if not destroy them. McNeil heard of
Marmaduke’s coming and retired to Cape Girardeau.
He was not willing to meet the Confederates in the
open field. The best that Marmaduke could count on
for fighting was thirty-five hundred men, a majority of
them inadequately armed. He was to face at Cape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</span>
Girardeau and elsewhere more than ten thousand men.
When the Federals started southwardly, after leaving
sufficient men to garrison Cape Girardeau, they had
forty-five hundred cavalry, forty-five hundred infantry
and fifteen pieces of artillery to join in the pursuit.</p>

<p>On the night of the 21st of April Captain John M.
Muse of the Missouri division had been ordered with
ninety men to Farmington, Missouri, in order to attempt
the destruction of the bridge of the St. Louis &amp;
Iron Mountain Railroad. This was to terrify St.
Louis and hold in check the garrisons north of Frederickstown.
He was to travel through the woods until
he reached Farmington. Enterprising, as well as brave,
Muse moved with the greatest celerity. The bridges
were all well guarded, and while he destroyed one bridge,
the task was performed under tremendous difficulties
and with supreme danger. The experiences of this
force for four days in the work assigned them was one
of the most difficult as well as the most dangerous and
heroic happenings of the whole war.</p>

<p>In those days it was easy enough to get into Missouri,
but sometimes it was extremely difficult to get
out. The Confederates were sorely pressed by two
commands, each of them outnumbering their forces.
Marmaduke and Shelby did not count the Federals
real peril. They believed they could, if necessary,
fight and rout these. They could not whip or outwit
the elements, and these gave them deep concern.
Heavy rains fell, and as there was nothing but mud roads
through the territory it required but a few hundred
cavalry to pass over one of these to render it thereafter
almost impossible to travel. But there was something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</span>
even worse than these rains and the roads. That was
the necessity of crossing swollen streams. Generals
can rely upon the fidelity and courage of their troops,
but they cannot control the weather. The heavy rains
at this period came most inopportunely for General
Marmaduke. When he realized the necessity of retiring,
he was miles north of Cape Girardeau. General
Vandever was behind him, and McNeil over at Cape
Girardeau had the shorter route, and with diligence and
energy could put himself at any time across his front.
The Federals were intensely aroused. They resented
this invasion and used the Mississippi and the Ohio
Rivers in the endeavor to put armies athwart the path
that Marmaduke must travel. The situation was full
of discouragement. One could not look ahead without
seeing dangers, nor think without facing difficulties.
The ownership of horses under the exigencies of such
a raid was never seriously considered, and while each
side would prefer to take from their enemies, they were
not unwilling, under the calls of necessity, in the end
to impress from their friends. Everything in the line
of march that could carry a man or that was better
than some man’s horse in the column was quickly
appropriated. The heavy marching, the muddy roads
and the constant rain had impaired the vitality of a
majority of the mounts of General Marmaduke’s men.
The horses sank to their knees in the mud, and to carry
the soldiers and their equipment and be subject to so
much that was injurious under foot not only seriously
tried the horses, but it laid grievous burdens upon the
men who marched in the rear. The Federal and Confederate
artillery had moved over these roads; Federal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</span>
supply wagons had cut them full of deep ruts, and jug
holes and gullies had been washed out, making the
movement of artillery tedious and difficult. Three
miles an hour with such passways and surroundings
would be rapid marching. Many sought to escape the
burdens and difficulties of the main road and scattered
along the woods or in the fields which lay alongside
the line of travel. No sooner would a third of the
command pass over any given part of the road than it
was a lagoon of mud and slush. Spattered in every
direction by the horses’ feet, this disgusting mixture
was plastered upon the backs and hips of the beasts
and the bodies of the men. Their necks and their
faces were encased with the horrible substance. The
sides of the horses were covered half an inch deep with
the mud, and the clothes of the men were so bespattered
that they looked as if they had been drawn through the
disgusting mixture. There were no farms, no stores,
and few homes to supply any food other than that carried
in their haversacks, and this, by the constant rains
and the churning on the backs of the men, became so
unpalatable that it required fiercest hunger to force
the men to eat at all.</p>

<p>When once the question of return was presented
and settled it became the paramount thought of the
hour. It would have been a tremendous blow to the
Confederacy to have had Marmaduke and his men
captured. The idea of surrender never entered the
minds of these raiders. The marching was to be rapid,
and the tired and hungry beasts could not expect much
rest from their labors. The most they could have was
to browse upon the grass which during the spring season<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</span>
had grown up in the woods and fields and pastures
along the roads. The closest point from Cape Girardeau
at which Marmaduke could cross the St. Francis River
would be fifty miles. The size of the division did much
to lengthen the hours of the march. Few cavalry commands
ever undertook to ride through any worse
country or to travel more difficult roads. The highway
was just broad enough for two soldiers to ride abreast,
and forty-five hundred men riding two abreast with
eight pieces of artillery makes a column from three to
five miles. There was no parallel road General Marmaduke
could use. It was necessary to keep the Confederates
in supporting distance to each other. The
men who were pursuing not only had the best mounts,
but they had complete supplies of every kind for man
and beast.</p>

<p>General Marmaduke dare not separate his forces
lest he should be attacked in detail by the forty-five
hundred cavalry who were following his train. It
might, and probably would happen, that he would
need every man he could summon. It required a beast
far less time to eat a gallon of oats or corn than to
satisfy its hunger by browsing in the woods or fields
and thereby secure a sufficiency to meet its hunger and
maintain its vitality. The Confederates’ ammunition
was now much impaired. The horses for the artillery
and the ammunition wagons and the ambulance had
been worn out by the march of two hundred and fifty
miles. Marmaduke resolved under no circumstances
to abandon his artillery. Among the cavalry, the horse
artillery was always to be saved, and only extraordinary
emergencies would justify any command in giving up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</span>
its guns. The armies, East and West, looked askance
at cavalry who abandoned or permitted the capture
of their artillery. Only extremest reasons would excuse
such results. Cannon suitable for the artillery in
Marmaduke’s Missouri department was not over-abundant,
and many requisitions and a good many
petitions had to be made before the meagre supply
possessed by the Missouri, Texas and Arkansas cavalry
could be obtained, and Marmaduke in conjunction
with Shelby resolved that only a great peril and severe
disaster would justify them in leaving or destroying
their few guns.</p>

<p>No officer had a tent. All—of whatever rank—took
pot-luck with the men on the ground. Here and
there a deserted stable, or an outhouse, or an abandoned
home might afford shelter for a small part of
the command. All were placed on a common level,
in-so-far as conveniences were concerned. No officer
was willing to accept anything better than that which
the men obtained. Some brush or evergreen limbs, or—if
the ravages of war had spared them—a few rails,
were laid upon the soaked earth. Over these a gum or
other blanket was spread, and these constituted the
couches upon which these brave and self-sacrificing
soldiers would find even a few hours of rest.</p>

<p>From Frederickstown to the St. Francis River was
seventy-five miles. Once the St. Francis was passed,
safety was assured. Starting from Frederickstown,
on the 27th of April, Shelby, Marmaduke and Carter,
the last men to cross the St. Francis River, went over
on the 1st of May. This ninety-six hours was used to
cover seventy-five miles. This was an average of three-quarters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</span>
of a mile per hour. There was no human
energy that could move a division at a much greater
rate of speed. Nature put every possible impediment
in the way of these tired, patient Confederate cavalry.
Hour by hour, the officers and the men watched the
falling rain, and they all understood that these meant
increasing difficulties and added danger, and greater
labor. The bridges had all been destroyed. Either
Federals or Confederates had burned them before.
Those who passed these streams must ford them or
provide temporary passways. Hours before, Marmaduke
and Shelby had been revolving in their minds
what might occur when they reached the St. Francis
River. They needed no weather prophet to tell them
what was going to happen from the incessant rains
which had fallen for the last four or five days. The
Confederates had no pontoon bridges and no pontoon
tackle. They had some axes, a few spikes, and the
pioneers a few augurs. With this limited equipment,
they understood that they must take what they could
find on the banks of the stream and construct something
that would carry over the guns and caissons and
at least permit the men to walk (even though the bridge
be partly submerged) across the rapid currents. The
pursuers well understood the thoughts that were passing
through the minds of the retreating Confederates.
If they were cornered, there could be no doubt that a
ferocious resistance would meet the men in blue. If
the worst came to the worst, Marmaduke and his men
might ride through and over the cavalry that was
pursuing them and they could sweep aside the infantry
that, by easy stages, along the lands outside the traveled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</span>
road, were seeking to overtake them or at least
to furnish backing for the cavalry who were to do the
aggressive and sharper work. There were many anxious
hearts among the forty-eight hundred Confederate
cavalry. The rank and file had supreme confidence in
both Marmaduke and Shelby. They were leaders who
never ran away without good reason, and few wished
to run away on this expedition. There was no place
where they could find even reasonable hope if scattered.
It was necessary for them to hang together and to
Shelby and his brigade was largely committed the defense
of the rear. They had been tried in many difficult
circumstances in the past and the three thousand Confederates
in front knew that they would discharge well
all the duties which might be committed to them in
this hour of extremity.</p>

<p>A trembling, crazy bridge had been built across the
St. Francis River. This was full from bank to bank.
Marmaduke, uneasy, had sent an engineer forward
to make provision for crossing his army when it should
reach the turgid stream. Shelby had ordered Major
Lawrence, his pioneer officer, to ride without let or
hindrance and construct the bridge, but Marmaduke
had pre-arranged this and when Shelby’s engineer
reached the river, the bridge was ready for use. It was
a slow process to erect this structure. Only men could
tread its swinging lines. These were compelled to cross
in single file. The river was not cold enough to seriously
chill the horses, and they took their chances in the rapid
currents. The artillery was the real perplexity. Huge
logs were cut down and fastened together, an unwieldy
raft was constructed, while an improvised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</span>
barge helped hold the mass in line, and a piece at a
time was run upon the raft and with great effort
ferried over. It was a weird scene that night on the
banks of the raging stream. All horses can swim, they
do not have to be taught as men. With them it is an
instinct. Fires were kindled along the bank, and with
some oaths and much belaboring the brutes, in the
darkness, were forced into the water. Some turned
back, but they were beaten over the head with brush
and limbs, and then some bold horsemen would plunge
in and turn their heads southward across the stream,
and, like a long flock of wild geese, with a leader, the
horses would paddle themselves across the river. Eight
hours of the night were consumed in this dangerous
undertaking. To cross four thousand men in single file,
and get eight pieces of artillery and eight caissons
on a square raft against a rapid current was no mean
task.</p>

<p>Two miles back on the road from the river was
another weird scene. There were no lights there.
General Shelby and his brigade were posted on each
side of the battery which occupied the highway, and
then the word was passed along the line that come what
might, not an inch of ground was to be yielded. These
orders are always portentous, and yet they are not
terrifying to brave men. A sense of duty comes to the
rescue of the human soul under such conditions, and
this calms fear and makes hearts unfaltering.</p>

</figure>

<p>The spirits of the weary horsemen rose to the sublimest
heights. There was not a minute in these eight
hours that a foe was not expected. Far out on the roads,
vigilant scouts were riding, and far back on the way,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</span>for several miles, videttes and squads were posted,
so as to catch the first sound of an enemy’s approach.
These were all watching and waiting to bring the Confederate
rearguard warning of the coming of a foe.
They had ridden hard every hour of the day. There
was neither corn nor hay nor oats to stay the pangs
of hunger which were felt by the half-famished beasts.
In sheer pity at first they were permitted, at the ends
of the halter, to nibble the grass which even the blight
and ravages of war could not destroy, but later this was
denied. Their browsing might disturb the acuteness
of hearing, and more than that, at any moment they
might be called to bear their masters into a night charge.
Hard as it looked, they were saddled and bridled, and
stood with their owners in line, waiting and ready to
fight any foe that might come.</p>

<p>There was no sleeping this night. It was a night of
danger, a night of extremest peril. Officers and men
stood around in groups, and attack was expected every
instant. A sleeping picket, forgetful of duty, at this
momentous instant, a forgetful scout, tired out it may
be by lengthened and incessant marching, might imperil
the safety of the entire command. Men were not
left alone to pass the fateful hours and important labors
of this crucial moment; they were placed two and two,
so that the strengthening of companionship would
help them bear the burdens and endure the hardships
of the weary hours and heavy tasks of the long, long
night. A foe filled with vengeful desire to capture and
destroy Marmaduke and his men was behind, and the
deep, seething river was in front. No eye could penetrate
far into the forest through which the column<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</span>
reached. Horses were brought close up to the line of
battle. Here and there a horseholder might steal a
cat nap, or at some moment when he was not watched,
might, beside a tree, or a stump, enjoy a brief sleep,
but it was only for an instant, for everybody was on
the lookout. A thousand men were to do an heroic
act for three thousand down at the river bank. Those
at the river bank might hear the sound of artillery and
the rattle of musketry, horses might be pushed into
the stream and the riders, stripped and holding to their
manes and tails, might possibly cross over the river,
but these men who had been placed on the outpost
with orders to stand in the face of all attacks, if need
be to die there, found no time for sleep.</p>

<p>Shelby and Shanks, and Gordon, and Carter, were
all there. They understood and appreciated the importance
of the work which had been given them to do.
The call of the impending crisis sounded in their ears
and filled their souls with sublime courage. The past
of these soldiers was a glorious and magnificent record.
This lifted them up into a frame of mind which nerved
them, if need be, to despise death and cheerfully to
perish at the post when duty called. They waited and
waited and waited, and no foe came. A little while
before the gray streaks of light came coursing in long
lines from the east, they were still ready to do and die.
A courier came to tell them that all but they had
passed the stream. The guns were limbered, and the
horses with the artillery in silence were turned toward
the St. Francis River, and Shelby and his men, with
such horses as had been retained for the use of the rearguard,
slowly and complacently rode down to the spot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</span>
where their comrades had spent the night in ferrying
the stream. All did not come at once. The line was
long extended, and when the vanguard and the artillery
reached the stream, the needed preparations to cross
had been made. Two trips put the artillery on the
south bank. The horses must take their chances in
the stream, and then the men in single file, with water
to their knees, slowly waded along the swaying bridge
that the currents moved to and fro and threatened to
engulf those treading it at every step.</p>

<p>In this retreat and escape across the river, somebody
had to be last, and that somebody must take not only
the chances of capture, but also the risks of annihilation.</p>

<p>Upon Captain George Gordon, with one hundred
and twenty Missourians, this burden was laid. He had
been marching and fighting and starving for more than
half a month. Shelby had told his men that, as the
rearguard, they must all stand together and if need be,
fall, and that he did not under any circumstances
intend to allow his artillery to be destroyed or captured.
Upon Captain George Gordon was laid the duty of
holding the last outpost, and with his men constitute
the forlorn hope in defense of this little army in its
passage of the St. Francis River.</p>

<p>The artillery had been saved. The rearguard,
mounted, was not yet over. The sun was just rising
when the raft made its last trip and landed the last
caisson on the southern bank of the stream. With the
sun came the Federal pursuers. They had not believed
the Confederates would be able in the night to cross
the St. Francis, and so they slept and waited, feeling
assured that on the morrow capture would be easy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</span>
The Federal sharp-shooters came pressing through the
heavy timber. They opened a severe fire, and the thud
of a minie ball, ploughing its way through the body
of some member of the faithful little rearguard, served
notice that trouble was abroad in the land. The
pressure grew stronger and stronger. Only a hundred
and twenty men in gray were on the north side. All
others were safely over the unfordable stream. Federal
cavalry riding in hot pursuit could be seen galloping
down the highway, and between them and the raging
river was only a small column of brave riders clad in
gray. The Confederates safely on the south bank
looked across the water and grieved at the fate of the
one hundred and twenty comrades who stood and held
the pursuers at bay until all the others were safely over.
Their courage and their generosity appealed to the
better instincts of the courageous soldiers. Some offered
to swim back and help and rescue the gallant remnant
who still remained on the north bank. Sharp-shooters
climbed the high trees on the south bank. Some
found cozy places on the hills close to the stream, and
with deadly aim warned the intruders to caution and
reserve.</p>

<p>The water was too deep and the currents too swift
to attempt with saddles and bridles and guns to swim
the weary beasts over, encumbered as they must be,
either in carrying or pulling their riders. There were
only three alternatives for these rearguardsmen. One
was to surrender; one was to swim, with the chance
that more than half would be drowned; and the other
was to ride up the stream and seek a more favorable
locality for passing the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</span></p>

<p>The Federal cavalry were in close and fierce pursuit.
Twice this gallant band attempted, when a
shallower spot had been found, to cross, but the Federals,
angered by the escape of the main army, felt that
they were bound to take this rearguard, and so they
pressed in upon them with much vigor and determination,
resolving to capture them at all hazards.</p>

<p>At last a better swimming place was found, and the
rearguard, resolving to die or drown rather than submit
to capture, forced their horses into the water. A
fusillade of shots was directed at them as they swam
across, and the bullets came quick and fast. These
spattered the water in the faces of the receding Confederates,
and here and there a fatal shot took effect
and the lifeless body of a Confederate floated a little
way on the surface and then sank in the current. Only
a few were killed or wounded. More than nine-tenths
of these brave fighters reached the opposite bank.</p>

<p>Shaking the water from their soaked garments,
the sharp-shooters turned and fired upon their pursuers,
and with steady and accurate aim avenged the death
and wounds of those who had suffered in this retreat.</p>

<p>Shelby and Colonel Gordon and Carter were the
last men to cross the bridge. Unsightly, tottering,
shaky, the bridge had served its purpose. It was not
much of a bridge, but it had saved four thousand men
and their equipment. Fastened with cables on the
south side, when Shelby and Carter stepped upon the
shore, a ready knife was drawn by one of his followers,
the moorings were cut and the faithful bridge, no longer
required, was turned loose down the stream. As it
floated out upon the rapid currents, the Federals on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</span>
the opposite side, in rage and disappointment, opened a
fusillade across the water, but a few well-directed shots
from the cannon drove them to cover, and Marmaduke,
Shelby and Carter and their followers, saved now from
pursuit, took up their journey to Jacksonport, sixty
miles away. They had no need now to hasten, there
was no foe to disturb, alarm and harass them. For
four days they waded and rode through muddy, slimy
swamps. The experience in these sloughs was horrible
in the extreme.</p>

<p>The troopers, willing to rest their faithful steeds,
dismounted and walked by their sides. Three times a
day they were permitted to graze upon the rich herbage
that lined the roads to Jacksonport. Separated along
different highways, both men and horses were treated
with the greatest consideration and given easy journeys
to the camp at Jacksonport, where the wounded might
mend, where the horses with scalded backs might
recuperate and permit their scars to be covered, and
the men might burnish their arms, repair their trappings,
wash their soiled garments, and be ready for
some other expedition at their country’s call.</p>

<p>For four days they had something to face worse
than enemies. They were compelled to wade and ride
through the muddy, slimy swamps south of the St.
Francis. These sloughs, generating miasma in every
particle that composed their horrible mixture, rendered
these ninety-six hours excruciatingly trying. There
was no escape from the slightly elevated roads that had
been cut through these forests and swamps. Only a
small portion of the cavalry and artillery could pass
along these roads until they became practically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</span>
impassable. The cannons were mired and the horses
were tramping in mud and slush above their knees.
With the gait of a snail, Marmaduke’s men walked and
rode amidst these dreadful surroundings. Had they
not been brave men, they would have preferred to have
laid down and died rather than to have endured the
horrors of this march. A common suffering made them
generous and helpful to each other. Food was scarce
for man, and there was practically none for the beasts,
and all pulled and labored through these quagmires.
Longing for the sight of higher ground, praying to escape
from these hateful and depressing surroundings,
the terribleness of the conditions prevented the men
from dismounting to help their wasted and emaciated
beasts. Here and there in the mud and slush, the poor
brutes, unable to move further, laid down in the water
and mud, and neither coaxing nor lashing could induce
them to rise. They preferred death to further torment
on this God-forsaken road, and all along the path
through these swamps, the beholder would constantly
see horses either dying under fatigue or so burdened
as to be unwilling to rise. They simply died rather
than take another step forward. The constant riding
by day and by night, the meagre supply of food, the
perils in conflict, the tremendous fatigue, the long, long
journey, all tried out their souls and their patience,
but the worst and hardest of all was the ninety-six
hours consumed in covering the horrible roads through
these dismal swamps and gloomy bayous.</p>

GENERAL WHEELER’S PURSUIT AND DEFEAT<br>
OF GENERALS STONEMAN, GARRARD AND<br>
McCOOK, JULY 27-AUGUST 5, 1864</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">By July, 1864, the storms were beating heavily and
mercilessly upon the Confederacy. The power
of numbers was beginning to tell. The resources
of the South, month by month, were more and more
impaired. Munitions of war and supplies of food became
the controlling elements, and in these the Confederates
fared most grievously. The arsenals and
manufactories were worked to their utmost limit, and
one of the most marvelous things connected with the
Confederate war was the ability of its people to supply
the necessities of the fighters. The disparity of fighting
men was tremendous, and the difference in resources
and supplies was to the South appalling. That the
war lasted so long is a most magnificent tribute to the
loyalty and the patience of the people of the Confederate
states. Few nations ever continued so fierce
a struggle with such inadequate resources for so lengthened
a period. The closest scrutiny of the conditions
under which the South made the contest only adds
wonder to the spirit and valor of those who thus hampered
by adversity and inadequate resources faced
so resolutely the losses, privations and sacrifices of so
many battles through such lengthened years.</p>

<p>Most of the adversities, as well as much of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</span>
severest fighting, marked the campaigns in Tennessee,
Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia. These
states covered a vast boundary and into their very
heart flowed many navigable streams. The Mississippi,
the Ohio, Cumberland, Barren, Tennessee and Yazoo
Rivers penetrated or skirted the regions this army was
required to defend, and rendered defense not only more
difficult, but made the movements of the armies more
hazardous.</p>

<p>No such disaster as at Fort Donelson or Vicksburg
was possible save in the territory defended by the
Army of Tennessee.</p>

<p>The Virginia campaigns were pressed into very
narrow limits and comparatively few miles of navigable
water affected its strategic movements. Indeed, the
James River was the only stream up which to any
great extent gunboats could float.</p>

<p>The Army of the Tennessee was to defend the line
from Pound Gap to the Mississippi River, a distance of
about five hundred miles. It was vulnerable at many
points, and the Mississippi, Ohio, Tennessee and Cumberland
not only brought legions of troops to important
military positions in this boundary, but also gave
strongholds from which operations at many points,
for a thousand miles, might be inaugurated. It was a
long distance from Paducah to Vicksburg. On the
navigable streams that bounded the western lines of
this army, forts and stations could be at various points
successfully established, and Paducah, Nashville, Memphis,
Chattanooga and Vicksburg were centers from
which forays could be successfully made for nine months
in the year. There was nothing but bad roads and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</span>
Confederate cavalry to defend this territory from
invasion or occupation.</p>

<p>Atlanta was evacuated on the 1st of September,
1864. General Joseph E. Johnson had been relieved
on the 17th day of July, 1864, and General Hood
assumed command. The enemy were close to the coveted
situation. Slowly, but surely, the cordon were
closing around Atlanta; and, as the flanks of the Federal
Army stretched far out, east and west of the doomed
city, the Federals began to employ their cavalry in
harassing the rear of the Confederates and in destroying
railroads south of General Hood’s position, rendering
not only its occupancy difficult, but the feeding of
his armies almost impossible.</p>

<p>The Federals never lacked for serviceable horses.
True, they were not up to the standard which the
Southern cavalry had taken into the war in 1861 and
’62; but well-fed, they could carry their riders, at a
moderate rate of speed, a long distance in the day.
Month by month, the Federal cavalry began to be
better disciplined and better drilled, and became a
great force in destroying the Southern armies. It required
months, many months, for the Federals to
learn successfully the plans under which the Confederate
cavalry operated and along which they had so often
disturbed and destroyed their communications; and
now, at least, when Hood was at bay in Atlanta, the
Federals, using their experience and the experience of
the Confederates to the best advantage, began their
raids. General Johnston had turned over to General
Hood, according to Johnston’s statement, forty-one
thousand infantry and ten thousand cavalry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</span></p>

<p>General Joseph Wheeler’s marvelous courage and
enterprise had greatly endeared him to all the soldiers
of the army of Tennessee. There was no service he
would not accept. There was no risk he would not
assume. On July 26th, 1864, with his limited command,
he had relieved Hardee’s corps, and taken the place
of the infantry in the breastworks. While thus occupied,
General Wheeler was informed that large cavalry
forces had started in the small hours of the night, with
ten days’ rations, marching eastwardly, westwardly,
southwardly from the rear of Sherman’s army. Sherman’s
front covered a space along the Chattahoochee
for twenty-five miles. It became apparent to General
Wheeler than an extremely formidable cavalry raid
was being inaugurated, and one which had most important
bearings on the maintenance of Hood’s army
about Atlanta. He chafed with the knowledge that
his dismounted men were in the infantry breastworks,
while the Federals were going out to forage and desolate
the country south of Atlanta, and wreck the railroads
upon which Atlanta relied alone for food.</p>

<p>On the morning of July 27th General Wheeler was
directed to still hold the breastworks from which Hardee
had been removed, and to send such force as he could
spare in pursuit of the Federal cavalry raiders. He
could only put into this service, immediately, fifteen
hundred men, and he could only hope that they would
be able to delay and harass and not destroy the enemy.
The Federal raiders had begun their march at daybreak,
on the 27th, and by nightfall had covered twenty-five
miles to the south. All through July 27th, at two
o’clock, at five o’clock and at six o’clock, Wheeler was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</span>
interchanging despatches with General Hood. Wheeler
was longing to go after the Federal raiders, but he
was denied, by General Hood, this opportunity. At
length the menace became so portentous that General
Hood dare not ignore its consequences. Realizing
that unless the Federal expedition was stayed, Atlanta
must fall, with reluctance and many misgivings, he
consented to turn General Wheeler loose, to try his
hand upon the numerous, vigorous and aggressive foe.
At nine o’clock at night came the order that General
Wheeler himself might go in pursuit of the enemy.
A great strategist himself, General Wheeler figured
in his mind about where the Federals would strike
the Macon railroad, which he foresaw and calculated
would be either at Jonesboro, fifteen miles, or Lovejoy
Station, twenty miles south of Atlanta.</p>

<p>General Sherman had passed the Chattahoochee
River. Atlanta was eight miles south of this stream.
Sherman had intrenched his forces east of Atlanta
about nine miles. Near Peach Tree Creek, the Confederates
had erected a strong line of fortification, and
against this Sherman was day by day forcing his
volunteers. At this time two railroads entered Atlanta
from the south. The Georgia Railroad, toward Augusta,
had already been occupied by Sherman and
destroyed, so as to be useless even if the Confederates
should drive him back across the Chattahoochee. For
several miles south of Atlanta, the two railroads now
operated ran into Atlanta over a common entrance.
One of these railroads, running southwest, reached the
Alabama line at West Point; the other ran due south,
leading to Macon, eighty miles distant. The Chattahoochee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</span>
River swung to the south as it passed west
from Atlanta.</p>

<p>General Sherman determined to start three cavalry
forces to break up these two railroads, upon which the
Confederates in Atlanta relied for transportation of
ammunition, food, supplies and troops. If these could
be destroyed, Atlanta must be evacuated. So long as
the Confederates could hold the fortifications around
Atlanta, and these two railroads, Atlanta was invincible.</p>

<p>General Sherman directed his subordinates to
start a cavalry force twelve miles due west of Atlanta,
on the Chattahoochee River, crossing at a place called
Campbellton. When over the river, this force, under
General E. M. McCook, was to move southeastward,
and strike the Macon Railroad at Jonesboro or at
Lovejoy. Two other forces of cavalry, under Generals
Stoneman and Garrard, were to leave General Sherman’s
lines east of Atlanta, at Decatur, to meet at
Lithonia, nine miles southeast from Atlanta, and
thence to tear up the railroad between Macon and Atlanta.</p>

<p>Up to this time, General Sherman had great faith
in General George Stoneman. This officer was born
in Chautaugua County, New York, in 1822. He
graduated at West Point in 1846, and entered the
First Dragoons. In 1855 he became a captain in the
25th United States Cavalry, and was in command of
Fort Brown when the Civil War broke out. He refused
to surrender Fort Brown to General Twiggs. In a
little while he became chief cavalry commander of the
Army of the Potomac. Transferred to infantry, he
became conspicuous in many of the great battles of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</span>
Virginia, and in 1863 became a leader of raids in Virginia.
One of his chief ambitions was to release the
Federal prisoners at Andersonville. He had been
given authority, under certain conditions, by General
Sherman, after destroying the railroad south of Atlanta,
to march through to Andersonville. Stoneman,
after the war, became colonel of the 21st Infantry of
the United States Army. In 1871 he retired and returned
to California. He was elected governor by the
Democrats, in 1883, and held this office for four years.
With his splendid record and his wide military experience,
much was expected of him in this ably-planned
onslaught that General Sherman had projected
on the Confederate lines.</p>

<p>General Edward M. McCook, who was to figure so
prominently in this expedition, was born in Steubenville,
Ohio, in 1835. He came of a family known as
the “fighting McCooks,” and fully measured up to the
family record. He was senior major of the 2d Indiana
Cavalry at Shiloh; then colonel at the Battle of Perryville
and Chickamauga. He commanded the cavalry
of the Army of the Cumberland during the Atlanta
campaign. Brave, self-reliant, with a lengthened
service, with his many successes in the past, both
Generals Grant and Sherman were confident that he
would give a most excellent account of himself at this
important juncture.</p>


<h3>GENERAL KENNER GARRARD</h3>

<p>General Kenner Garrard, the third man, was born
in 1830 in Cincinnati, and was a great grandson of
James Garrard, once governor of Kentucky. He graduated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</span>
from the United States Military Academy in
1851, and entered the Dragoons. While on the Texas
frontier, in April, 1861, he was captured and afterwards
released on parole, but was not exchanged until
1862. During this period, he was commandant of
cadets at West Point. After successful service in the
Rappahannock and Pennsylvania campaigns, he was
promoted to command a cavalry division of the Army
of the Cumberland.</p>

<p>It was not unreasonable for General Sherman to
expect much of these three dashing and brave commanders.
With more than nine thousand cavalrymen,
General Sherman believed that they could march into
any part of the South, and that no force the Confederates
could muster could even greatly delay and surely
not defeat them.</p>

<p>General Wheeler had under him, in his defensive
operations, men who had done much fighting, and,
wherever tried, had never failed.</p>

<p>General Alfred Iverson was born in Clinton,
Georgia, on February 14th, 1829. He graduated from
a military school and served in the Mexican War when
only seventeen years old. For distinguished service,
he was made first lieutenant of the United States
Cavalry. He was in Kansas during the troubles in
1856, and was with the expedition against the Mormons,
and also in that against the Comanches and the Kiowas,
in which he made much reputation. He resigned when
Georgia seceded, and went to Wilmington, North
Carolina. Later, he became colonel of the 20th North
Carolina Infantry. He won distinction at Gaines Mill,
and was wounded during a seven days’ fight around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</span>
Richmond, and added to his laurels at South Mountain
and Sharpsburg. He was made brigadier general in
1862. At Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, he acquitted
himself with great credit, and later he was sent
to Rome, Georgia to command the state forces, and
became brigadier general of the Georgia Cavalry. He
was attached to Martin’s division, under General
Wheeler.</p>


<h3>GENERAL WILLIAM WIRT ALLEN</h3>

<p>General William Allen was born at Montgomery,
Alabama. He was made a captain of the 1st Alabama
Cavalry, and then its colonel. He was in the Kentucky
campaigns, and was wounded at Perryville in 1864.
He was made colonel of the 6th Alabama Cavalry
Regiment, then commissioned a brigadier general.
In the closing days of the war, in Georgia, North and
South Carolina, he evidenced great skill as a leader.
Always cheerful, patient and brave, he did much to
inspirit his men, when, to his foreseeing mind, it was a
hopeless fight against heaviest odds.</p>


<h3>GENERAL ROBERT H. ANDERSON</h3>

<p>General Robert H. Anderson, who also took a
prominent part in these stirring campaigns, was born
at Savannah, Georgia, in 1835. He graduated from
West Point in 1857. He was on the frontier from
1857 to 1861, and was with the Georgia troops at Fort
McAllister. His pluck and courage won him the command
of the 5th Georgia Cavalry. After a little while,
he proved himself so competent that he was advanced
to a brigade commander; and, in the dark hours—from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</span>November, 1864, to April, 1865—in the closing
scenes and in front of Sherman in his march to the sea,
he bore a most conspicuous and valorous part.</p>

<h3>GENERAL JOHN H. KELLEY</h3>

<p>General John H. Kelley was born in Pickens
County, Alabama, in 1840. At the age of seventeen,
he entered West Point. Within a few months of his
graduation, Alabama seceded, and he went to Montgomery,
enlisted in the government service and became
second lieutenant in the regular army. He was sent
to Fort Morgan; and, in October, 1861, became aide
to General Hardee, with the rank of captain and
assistant adjutant general. Later, he was made major,
in command of an Arkansas battalion. Fearless,
enterprising and courageous, he was promoted to
colonel of the 8th Arkansas Regiment. He was then
just twenty-two years of age. Conspicuous at Perryville,
Murfreesboro and at the Battle of Chickamauga,
he became commander of a brigade of infantry, under
General Buckner. At Chickamauga, his brigade suffered
a loss of three hundred men out of eight hundred
and seventy-six. His great merit was recognized; and,
on the 16th of November, 1863, he was made brigadier
general, when only twenty-three and one-half years old.
Almost immediately, he was assigned to the duties of
major general. At the beginning of the Georgia campaign,
he became one of the division commanders,
under General Wheeler. His division was composed
of Allen’s, Dibrell’s and Hannon’s brigades. He was
doomed to die just one month after this raid, at
Franklin, Tennessee,—a spot three months afterward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</span>
consecrated by the sublime heroism of the Army of
the Tennessee, in its last great call to duty, where it
met practical annihilation.</p>


<h3>GENERAL LAWRENCE SULLIVAN ROSS</h3>

<p>General Lawrence Sullivan Ross was Iowa born.
His father moved to Texas during his early life. He
entered a college at Florence, Alabama, but engaged
in the Indian war and was wounded at the Battle of
Wichita. In this battle, he rescued a white girl who
had been with the Indians eight years, adopted her as
his own child, giving her the name of Lizzie Ross. His
courage was so pronounced and his skill so evident, that
General Van Dorn and General Scott urged him for a
place in the army. Not of age, he went back to the
University and graduated, when he returned to Texas
and enlisted as a private in the 6th Regiment. He
became its colonel in 1862. At Corinth, he played the
part of a hero—acting as a forlorn hope—he held the
Federals at bay until the balance of the army escaped.
For this great service, General Joseph E. Johnson
recommended his promotion as brigadier general,
and this came to him in December, 1863. He was
always at the front, and had five horses shot under him.
He became governor of Texas in 1886 and again in 1888,
and was elected by one of the largest majorities ever
given any man—a hundred and fifty thousand.</p>

<p>Colonel W. C. P. Breckinridge, on account of the
illness of General John S. Williams, was assigned the
command of the Kentucky brigade. In these days of
depletion, brigades were not very strong in numbers.
They very frequently had as few as five hundred men.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</span>
This little brigade, however, was well seasoned, and
though two-thirds of its original members were dead
or disabled, the small remnant had lost none of that
courage and valor which was regarded as the unfailing
inheritance of men who left Kentucky to fight for
Southern independence. A sketch of Colonel Breckinridge
will be found in another part of this volume.</p>

<p>These were the leaders who, in this momentous
hour, were to stand for the Confederate and Federal
operations. Rarely, during the war, did so many West
Pointers come into collision, or men so trained and so
resourceful meet in battle or engage in maneuvering,
when a mistake would mean so much to contending
forces.</p>

<p>The Chattahoochee River was to play an important
part in this historic cavalry movement. Rising in the
Appalachian Mountains of Northern Georgia, it flows
west, passing within eight miles of Atlanta; then,
traversing almost the entire state of Georgia, it strikes
the Alabama boundary at West Point. For one hundred
miles, it becomes the boundary between Alabama
and Georgia, and at the Florida line unites with the
Flint River and forms the Appalachicola River, which
empties into the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>The expedition was worthy of General Sherman’s
splendid military genius. It was thoroughly discussed,
wisely planned and ably conceived, and the men that
he assigned were not only the best officers, but they had
also under them the best regiments then in the three
divisions of the army that he was directing against
Atlanta.</p>

<p>General Kelley was designated by General Wheeler,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</span>
with his brigade, to follow General Garrard, whose
division was the first of the Federal forces to concentrate
at Jonesboro and Lovejoy. Garrard seems to
have failed in his part of the undertaking. He got as
far as Flat Rock, and there he waited for General
Stoneman; but Stoneman seemed to have forgotten
his promise and Garrard stayed at Flat Rock until the
28th, waiting for Stoneman, and then marched to
Covington. He there found that Stoneman had passed
through Covington two days before and had gone
south. Garrard then returned from whence he had
come. Harassed, opposed and vigorously pursued by
General Kelley, he accomplished no real service; he
saved his forces and suffered but little loss, but he won
no praise; he deserved none for anything he accomplished.
He attempted to place the blame for his
failure on General Stoneman. In his report to headquarters,
he said: “On the 27th, the division was placed
under General Stoneman, who ordered it to Flat Rock
and abandoned it to its fate. After being surrounded
by a superior force for over twelve hours, and contending
against every disadvantage in hopes of benefiting
General Stoneman in his attempt to destroy the
railroad, it extricated itself from its perilous situation.”
Had he followed on after General Stoneman, in General
Iverson’s rear, he might have won for both a superb
victory. Instead of being surrounded by a superior
force, General Kelley, who opposed him, had less than
one-third of the men General Garrard led. If General
Sherman later read General Wheeler’s reports, he would
have wondered where the superior Confederate forces
came from.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</span></p>

<p>General Iverson, being thoroughly familiar with
the territory where General Stoneman was to operate,
was assigned to the pursuit of that officer. General
Wheeler, who had so furiously chafed at being cooped
up with infantry in the breastworks along Peach Tree
Creek, decided to follow General McCook, who he
seemed to fear most, and whose past was a sure indication
that where he went, trouble would be raised for
the Confederate outposts, railways and storehouses.</p>

<p>When General Wheeler got away from Hood’s
breastworks, at nine o’clock, in the night of the 27th,
he needed no signal of the officers or scouts to tell him
the purpose or design of the enemy. His military
instincts told him that these skillful Federal generals
would strike the railroad somewhere south of Atlanta,
and at a point just sufficiently away to escape from
the attacks of the Confederate infantry. In his breast
most conflicting emotions arose. Released by General
Hood, only when his pleading became well nigh irresistible,
he was not only anxious to meet General
Hood’s expectations, but he was also well aware that
his failure to stop the progress of the Federal cavalry
meant the immediate evacuation of Atlanta, and with
this, the crushing of the hopes of his countrymen for
ultimate success in the war. It is also highly probable
that, calm and self-possessed though he was, recent
criticism had given a deep touch of sorrow to his heart.
Envy had not been idle, and this had raised a horde of
heartless slanderers, who were doing all they could to
belittle his services to his country: to minimize the
successes of his campaign and to destroy his reputation
as a leader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</span></p>

<p>General Wheeler at this moment assumed a task
at which any soldier might hesitate. Many Confederate
cavalry leaders had faced Federal raiding forces;
but generally the invaders had long lines to follow and
could not set out three divisions, all numerically
superior to those opposing, and all converging to a
single point by different roads—all within ten hours’
march of the place where it was proposed to strike
the heaviest blow. Whatever was to be done must be
done instantly and with fiercest determination. He
could not count upon more than two-fifths as many
men as those he was to fight. If he whipped one, the
other two might unite, accomplish the purposes of the
expedition, and then together might crush him; and
this meant untold disaster to General Hood. There
was no sleep for General Wheeler that trying night:
its hours were long. His staff and the few troopers
following behind might, by a cat-nap in the saddle,
gain a momentary relief; but, for the leader, the man
who was to checkmate the Federal plans, there could
not be a single instant of unconsciousness. He weighed
then less than a hundred and twenty-five pounds, but
he was a great soldier all the same. In the mind and
soul of this man, small of stature, was now centered
the destiny of Hood’s army.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="p659" style="max-width: 54.5625em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">MAP OF WHEELER’S PURSUIT OF GARRARD AND McCOOK,
AND IVERSON’S PURSUIT AND CAPTURE OF STONEMAN</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Plan after plan suggested itself to the brave man,
who, at a rapid trot, in the darkness, was leading his
followers to the scene of danger. Those who rode behind
him could not understand the conflicting emotions
that passed through his mind. They knew but little
of the dangers ahead—they did not fully comprehend
what this forced march meant; but they all knew there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</span>was trouble somewhere to the front, and possibly
before dawn, but surely at dawn they realized that a
foe would be found and that a battle would be joined.
It was yet too early for any well-defined plan to take
shape in the mind of the Confederate leader. Of only
one thing he was absolutely sure, and that was when
he found his enemies, he would give them no rest or
peace until they were driven back behind the Federal
fortification. It is difficult for a cavalry commander
to always conceal from his followers the purpose or
plans of an expedition. Those riding behind General
Wheeler disturbed him with no questionings or suggestions.
They sympathized with him in the stress
and turmoil that filled his soul in this period of anxious
foreboding and planning. The hours now passing were
fraught with ever-present dangers. The ninety days
that preceded the experiences of this night had been
the most eventful of any ninety days any cavalry
commander had ever faced, but now was to come the
hardest of all.</p>

<p>From May 8th to September 5th, 1864, covering
the retreat from Dalton to Atlanta, there had been
imposed upon the cavalry of the Army of the Tennessee,
a service, which for length, sacrifice, constant exposure,
varied experiences and extent of losses, was never experienced
by the same number of horsemen who followed
the Confederate colors in an equal number of
days.</p>

<p>General Wheeler pressed onward with great rapidity,
to overtake the fifteen hundred men who had been
sent forward on the morning of the 27th, and by a
rapid ride of thirty miles, he caught up with the troops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</span>
that had gone before. Through prisoners and scouts,
he there learned that the force which had crossed at
Campbellton was commanded by General McCook.
General Wheeler at this time fully realized the difficult
task before him, and its responsibilities, to a less great
man, would have been appalling. Had he been left
alone to face General McCook, there would have been
no disturbing element in his work, but from couriers
and other means of communication, it became necessary
for him to divide the men he could use in this
crisis, so that no one of the three Federal divisions
could, for any considerable period, march unmolested.
It was of the greatest importance to leave neither
Stoneman, Garrard nor McCook unopposed for even
half a day. This also meant that in all three cases the
men pursuing must be vastly inferior in numbers to
the command they were to endeavor to defeat or drive
away.</p>

<p>He could only give Iverson fourteen hundred men;
Kelley six hundred men; while he himself took the
brigades of Hume and Anderson—counting, all told,
eight hundred riders. With this limited force, General
Wheeler vigorously assaulted the Federals at Flat
Shoals. In disposing his forces as the necessity of the
moment suggested, he was extremely generous to his
subordinates. He gave Iverson the most; Kelley
the second largest command; while he himself, with
fragments of two brigades, undertook the destruction
of General McCook. To do this, he had in the beginning
less than eight hundred men as against three
times that number.</p>

<p>When General Wheeler arrived at Flat Shoals, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</span>
was not yet light; day was just breaking. It was
bright enough to see the enemy and that was enough
for General Wheeler. He instantly ordered an attack
upon the flanks of the Federals. He had managed,
during the night, to get a portion of his command
in front of the enemy, and with the forces in front and
Wheeler in the rear, the Federals soon realized that
they had gone upon an expedition in which there would
be more than marching and burning. General Wheeler
dare not waste a single moment. The Federals had
secured strong and favorable positions; but he had
no time to reconnoiter for position. He knew where
the enemy was, and that was all that he desired to
know just then. He had come to defeat them, and
defeat them he must. Although his forces were inadequate,
he advanced boldly to the attack. The Federal
forces withstood the assault for a brief while. These
responses from the enemy only caused General Wheeler
to renew the attack more viciously, and shortly the
enemy began to retreat. Their rearguard was not disposed
to run, and they fought over every inch of ground.
In this first conflict, General Wheeler captured three
supply wagons and a number of prisoners, and from
these he discovered that Stoneman had gone to Covington,
and that the men he was now fighting were McCook’s
division. He was fortunate enough to learn
from the captured prisoners that Macon was the real
point of attack, and that Stoneman, Garrard and McCook
were supposed to unite at that point and destroy
Macon with its precious stores and manufactories,
which were so essential to the preservation of Hood’s
army; then march to Andersonville and release thirty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</span>
thousand prisoners, and in Stoneman’s wagons were
guns to arm these prisoners.</p>

<p>General Hood was not disposed to let Wheeler get
very far from him. He relied with absolute confidence
upon his invincible courage and indomitable will. He
felt stronger when Wheeler was near. In a little while,
after Wheeler had left on his night ride, General Hood
sent him a message, by a trusted courier, to say that
if the enemy’s course was not such as to require all
his men, to detach some officer to continue the pursuit,
and he himself should come back to the front. He wisely
added, by way of parenthesis, that he would rely on
General Wheeler’s judgment as to what would be the
wisest thing to do. General Hood had not caught the
real import of this cavalry expedition. He did not know
the thorough preparations General Sherman had made
to render this movement a decisive one; he did not
know the vast force engaged in the campaign, nor did
he at once take in what its success meant to his beleaguered
army in and around Atlanta. He had not
yet fully comprehended what faced General Wheeler
in the work assigned him, nor how much depended
on his success.</p>

<p>Wheeler’s one oft-reiterated command was, “Attack!
Attack! Assault! Assault!” wherever an enemy could
be found.</p>

<p>General Wheeler quickly discovered that General
McCook’s men, something over twenty-five hundred,
had gotten in their work on the railroad, four miles
below Jonesboro. He knew at once that he alone was
in a position to discomfit McCook. He resolved to
trust Iverson with Stoneman, while he would assault<span class="pagenum" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</span>
and crush McCook. General McCook had found it
necessary to stop and rest at Fayetteville. The strain
on man and beast became unbearable and General
McCook submitted to nature’s inevitable decree for
rest. This halt did much towards his undoing.</p>

<p>General W. H. Jackson had done some skirmishing
with McCook during the day, and he had informed
General Wheeler that if he would take care of the
enemy’s rear, he would gain their front and secure their
capture. General Wheeler could not rely much upon
Jackson. He was now fifteen miles behind, and Hume’s
brigade of only five hundred men was the chief ground
of General Wheeler’s hope in the pursuit. When Line
Creek was reached, the bridge was gone—the Federals
had destroyed it and had barricaded the opposite bank.
Fights had no terror for General Wheeler. He boldly
marched up to the banks and managed to get a position
that enfiladed the barricades on the opposite shore.
The attack was furious. In a little while it caused the
enemy to yield. Within an hour the bridge was rebuilt,
and General Wheeler’s troops had passed over. The
night was intensely dark: objects could only be seen
at a very limited distance. General Wheeler, taking
the extreme advance, courageously and vigorously
pushed forward. Almost every half hour the enemy
had barricaded the road, and the first notice the Confederates
had of their presence was a volley from their
guns.</p>

<p>With the dawn of another day, General Wheeler
became even more persistent and pressed the charge
against the enemy with ever-increasing vigor. He
knew that now he only had about seven hundred men.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</span>
He sent one column around their flank, while he led the
other upon the Federal center. Breaking through
McCook’s lines, he routed their horses and captured
more than three hundred prisoners, with their arms and
equipment. The Federals were diligent in taking advantage
of the various positions which the country
afforded, and met each charge with stout resistance;
and during the running fight, hand-to-hand encounters
were frequent—more than fifty Federals were killed
in these face-to-face struggles. Nothing could stay the
impetuous advance of Wheeler and his men. Barricades,
hills and rail fortifications had apparently no
terror for the pursuers. They were after the enemy,
and as long as they saw the enemy, they followed him
with unfailing vigor.</p>

<p>Human nature had nearly reached its limit with
General Wheeler’s troops when he was reinforced with
Colonel Cook’s two squadrons, of the 8th Texas; these
hard-riding Texans had followed in the wake of the
conflict—the dead soldiers, broken-down horses and
wrecked wagons told them where they were needed.
They could see that savage work had gone on a little
while before, and General Wheeler’s followers appeared
to be calling, with earnest pleas, for them to hasten and
help destroy the fleeing and vanquished foe. They
were few in number, but they rushed on, for they well
knew how much their presence was needed at the front.</p>

<p>General Ross also came on with two fragments of
regiments, making General Wheeler’s available command
now seven hundred men.</p>

<p>Jackson and Anderson were still fifteen miles in
the rear, and they could bring no help to Wheeler at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</span>
this time, in the very throes of the combat that was
to determine the mastery in this expedition.</p>

<p>Like Forrest in pursuit of Streight, Wheeler and
his followers were absolutely relentless. They marched
seventy miles in twenty-four hours. Hunger and
fatigue seemed to have fled from the minds and bodies
of the ragged pursuers, and a strength and endurance
above human animated and encouraged them in the
work war had at this hour put upon them. They were
ready and willing to fight and harass the Federal
forces so long as a single man was left. The beasts,
many of them, were dropping by the roadside. They
could not stand the intense strain that was being put
upon them. The long marches, the incessant galloping
and heavy burden in transporting the men and ammunition,
had tremendously told upon the helpless horses;
but a great issue was at stake, and horse flesh was not
to be considered. Colonel Ashby, with two hundred
men, was directed to gallop forward, and, if possible,
to get in front of General McCook. He was further
ordered, if an enemy was found, not to consider the
disparity in numbers, but to go at them promptly and
remorselessly. Scouts were sent in every direction to
look for the enemy. Out on the LaGrange Road, about
three miles away, the Federal cavalry was found,
dismounted, in a dense wood. Colonel Ashby, who
always put himself in front, informed General Wheeler
that he had struck the head of the advancing Federals,
and that they were then forming a line of battle. The
only answer General Wheeler made to Ashby was to
make the attack, and do the best he could with the
means at hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</span></p>

<p>General Wheeler now had less than four hundred
men in the column. The long trail of killed and
wounded that lay along the line of pursuit told what
had depleted his following. The first advance upon
McCook was checked, and for a moment Wheeler’s
forces were stayed; but, in an instant, General Wheeler
directed all bugles to sound the charge, and the brave
little Confederate general, at the head of the advance,
bade his men to follow and he would lead. The rebel
yell was the response to this heroic call. No man hesitated
for an instant or desired to get away. Wheeler
was leading them and in front was the enemy. General
Wheeler drove his column through the Federal lines
and crumpled them up into a confused mass. Up to
that time, only two of General McCook’s brigades had
taken part. There was yet a reserve brigade some
distance away.</p>

<p>In less than three-quarters of an hour General
Wheeler had captured three hundred prisoners, two
hundred men had been killed or wounded, and best of
all, he captured six hundred fresh horses for the tired
Confederates to mount.</p>

<p>In the fierceness of this struggle, General Wheeler
had almost forgotten himself and his own safety. He
was recalled to the real situation by the heavy firing
in the rear, and there he beheld McCook’s reserve
brigade attacking the Confederate lines. General
Wheeler turned about and quickly faced this new
danger. By voice and example, he pleaded with his
soldiers to stand firm and meet the coming shock.
They responded as he asked; they boldly charged the
new foes, broke their lines, captured over a hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</span>
prisoners and sent this reserve brigade in search of
General McCook, to seek safety.</p>

<p>General McCook had gotten his breath and was
organizing his forces again for battle. Unexpectedly
to Wheeler, he charged with fierceness on the Confederates,
who were now beginning to yield. General
Humes had been taken a prisoner, and it looked like
the thin Confederate line would be swept away, and
McCook would avenge the damage that had been
inflicted upon him a few moments before.</p>

<p>At this critical period, while looking, listening and
hoping, rapid riding was heard, and then in a little
while, some riders clad in gray galloped to the front.
General Anderson’s men had come to relieve the plight
into which General Wheeler’s daring had brought him.
General McCook, like all the McCooks, was dead game,
and so he barricaded himself in an impassable ravine,
against which General Wheeler at once realized it was
useless to go. But the flank was the point where
General Wheeler frequently struck home, and he instantly
turned his men in that direction. Here General
Wheeler was able to cut off two of McCook’s regiments.
When these were separated, they became scattered,
a majority of them surrendered, bringing to General
Wheeler a battery, a wagon train, a pack mule train
and much needed arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>Among the captured was something that was very
pleasing to General Wheeler—that was three hundred
and fifty Confederate officers, who had been picked
up by McCook in convalescent camps along his route.
Gratifying as was the recapture of these Confederate
officers, General Wheeler had no time to waste and no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</span>
season for congratulations. Turning about, he charged
at McCook’s troops, again cutting them in two, and
drove both fragments before him in a rout. After
fighting so bravely, the Federals, in this last conflict, did
not measure up to the splendid standard they had set
in the earlier fighting, and by a sort of common consent
and agreement, every command began to look out for
itself. General Roddy, with a few dismounted men,
appeared upon the scene. This was counted as Confederate
infantry, and this destroyed all hope of victory
in the minds of the Federals.</p>

<p>Night now came on, and the darkness was so intense
that it was impossible to keep trail of the fleeing enemy.
They were traveling by stars or blindly following the
roads. Confederate patrols were sent out in every
direction, and before daylight four hundred prisoners
were caught.</p>

<p>This campaign was one of the most skillful efforts
on General Sherman’s part in his fight for Atlanta.
General Wheeler’s courage, genius and indomitable
will won success for the Confederates. And no general,
with such inadequate means at his command, could
accomplish more against such vast odds.</p>

<p>On the 26th of July, General Sherman telegraphed
that he had sent around by his right, three thousand
five hundred cavalry, under McCook; and by the left,
five thousand, under Stoneman. He believed that
McCook and Garrard would destroy the railroad to
Macon and that they would be able to march to Andersonville,
and release the Federal prisoners, but he had
forgotten the manner of men who were across the
Federal path.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</span></p>

<p>Not for a single moment did General Kelley lose
his grip on Garrard. Nor did Iverson ever hesitate
in his pursuit of Stoneman.</p>

<p>Stoneman had caught the real greatness of this
campaign, which General Sherman and General Grant
believed would be fatal and final to the defense of
Atlanta. Ambitious and enthusiastic, he suggested to
General Sherman that after traveling ninety miles to
Macon, and destroying the immense stores and the
great manufactories there, he should then pursue his
way to Andersonville, forty miles southwest of Macon.
Here were thirty thousand Federal prisoners. Stories
of their sufferings and privations moved Stoneman to
not only vigorous but patriotic effort. He was so hopeful
of capturing not only Macon and all in it, according
to General Sherman’s instructions, but he felt equally
sure of undisputed success and victory, and he took
along with him guns to arm the prisoners at Andersonville,
when they should be released. This numerous
array of men, armed, and this great multitude of prisoners,
turned loose, would have not only brought tremendous
desolation, but would have terrorized the
people of Georgia outside the armies of General Hood
and the garrison at Macon and a few important points.
It was a noble ambition. It was a splendid design, but
in the end it turned out that Stoneman did not have
the nerve, the dash and the grit necessary to consummate
the splendid conception. He made a rapid and
unmolested march through Covington, Monticello,
Hillsboro and Clinton, down to the very gates of Macon.
He got so close to the city that some of his artillery
threw shells into its suburbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</span></p>

<p>Macon, at that time, happened to have a sagacious
and experienced soldier in its boundaries. General
Joseph E. Johnston, after being relieved of command
of the army of Tennessee, at Atlanta, had gone to
Macon to rest and recuperate, and in dignified quiet
to await another call from his country, to stand for the
defense of its liberty. There were large numbers of
prisoners at Macon as well as at Andersonville. When
at Macon, the story of the approach of Stoneman and
his associates became known, the prisoners were speedily
moved to points further south. The garrison, and
the convalescents and all, however old or young, that
were able to bear arms, were hastily summoned and
organized, to resist the coming of the invaders. Breastworks
and fortifications were erected under the direction
of General Johnston, and every possible effort was
made to prepare for sternest defense, the city with its
rich stores.</p>

<p>General Stoneman was to have had the co-operation
of General Garrard, and incidentally of General McCook,
but he had gone southward for ninety miles
without opposition, and the march had been so easy
and so little opposed, and he had been able to burn so
many stores and trains, that he felt he had the world
in a sling, and that there was nothing could stay his
progress or interfere with his success. He was only a
little more than twenty miles from Jonesboro when he
passed Covington; Garrard could have reached him,
by an easy march, in eight hours. Had he waited for
McCook or Garrard, with whom he was directed to co-operate,
he would have largely increased his chances
for success and victory; but it looked so feasible, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</span>
he was able to move with such rapidity, that he cast
prudence to the winds, and he rode forward without
even the suggestion of doubt crossing his mind. He
thought he surely saw the beckonings of greatness.
He was certain he heard the voices of fame whisper
in his ears: “Forward! Forward!” He did not know
what was behind him, nor did he care. He knew as
well as the Confederates themselves that the exigencies
around Atlanta would permit of the removal of not
more than four thousand cavalry, and he was certain
all these would not dare follow him, and let Garrard
and McCook roam at will around and south of
Jonesboro and Lovejoy. Sherman had some reserve
horsemen, and these must be guarded against.</p>

<p>No Confederate cavalryman ever faced graver
responsibilities or greater difficulties than General
Wheeler in this expedition. His mounts were thin,
wearied and worn. His men were only fairly armed.
Stoneman had fresh, well-fed mounts, and he could
out-march and out-ride anything that Wheeler and
his associates could put behind him. The men in gray
were hardier and better seasoned, but their means of
transportation were very much limited.</p>

<p>General Wheeler put into Iverson’s mind all that
the success of the Federals meant. Iverson knew it
all, but the defiant and hopeful spirit of the brave
Confederate leader helped him to greater effort and
firmer resolves. He bade him pursue Stoneman, fight
him wherever he found him, and hang on to his flanks
and rear with a savage grip, and never give him a
moment’s rest until he had run him to bay.</p>

<p>Stoneman could ride faster than Iverson. He bade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</span>
him do with Stoneman what he would do with McCook.
Iverson had some Georgians and Kentuckians, all told,
thirteen hundred men, but they were veterans. Many
of these had been long trained in General Wheeler’s
school and some of them in Forrest’s, and that meant
that wherever they met an enemy there would be real,
sure enough fighting. When Stoneman reached Macon
he was surprised to find such intense opposition. He
had expected to ride into the city with little ado, but
when he saw the organized troops and temporary
fortifications, and guns behind them, and men behind
these, he appears to have lost his nerve. Between
Stoneman and his subordinates there was not that
sympathy and confidence that such an occasion as
this demanded. Had Stoneman pushed on to Andersonville,
he could have done the Confederacy tremendous
and irreparable damage, but he hesitated and lost.
He then realized that he had made a great mistake
to ride away without McCook or Garrard. He had
hoped and trusted that one or the other would follow
him, and with forty-five hundred men, before the gates
of Macon, there would have been little question of its
capture. He understood now that his ambition had
led him to disregard the plainest dictates of military
prudence, and instead of going on and swinging around
Macon to Andersonville, and then into Alabama, if
necessary, on which line he could always keep ahead
of the Confederates who were pursuing him, he resolved
to retrace his steps and go back from whence
he had come. The coming had been easy, but the going
back was to be a far different and more difficult job.
Iverson’s men, although handicapped by the bad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</span>
condition of their horses, had been enabled, during the
time Stoneman had lost around Macon, to come up
with a strong vanguard. General Iverson was experienced,
brave, vigorous and enterprising. He had
not hitherto had the opportunities and confidence that
a separate command gives, but he realized his responsibilities
now, and he knew that continuous and savage
attack was the only method with which he could win.
He had kept himself well in touch with Stoneman’s
movements. The people along the line were friendly to
him, and there was no difficulty in his learning where
Stoneman was and what Stoneman had.</p>

<p>When Stoneman turned about, he had only gone a
few miles when he found the gray-coated men athwart
his path. He had lost his head. He was brave, but he
was not his greatest in disaster, which is a most important
qualification in a cavalry general. He assaulted
Iverson’s forces with moderate vigor. He
found them unyielding. They met assault with assault.
They returned shot for shot. They had artillery,
and they knew how to use it, and General Stoneman
quickly realized that he was now to have the fight of
his life, and not only the fight of his life, but a fight
for life.</p>

<p>Through the morning of September 1st, the battle
was kept up, but in the afternoon the Confederates
became more aggressive, and they assaulted Stoneman’s
left flank, and drove it in, and from that moment
Stoneman’s troops seemed to have parted with their
courage and their faith of ultimate victory.</p>

<p>Colonel Silas Adams, with a brigade, went one
direction; and Colonel Capron, with another brigade,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</span>
went another, both riding hard and striving furiously
to get away from their pursuers. Stoneman gathered
a portion of his advisers around him and communicated
to them his judgment. They unanimously agreed that
he had lost. He made a heroic but very foolish resolve
to fight with six hundred men, long enough to enable
Adams and Capron to get the start of Iverson’s troops,
and through this to make their escape.</p>

<p>It would have been more soldier-like to have let
Capron or Adams fight in the last ditch while the
leader rode away. It looked and sounded heroic for
the commander to make such a sacrifice, but Federal
generals like Pleasanton, Sheridan, Wilson or Buford,
nor Confederate, like Forrest, Wheeler, Shelby, Morgan,
Marmaduke, Stuart or Hampton, would never
have entertained such a proposition. They would have
kept all their forces together and fought it out in the
last ditch. When the Confederates cut Stoneman’s
command into two parts, they had won the victory,
and turned his forces into scattered bands, whose
chiefest aim was personal safety and escape.</p>

<p>Separated from Stoneman, Adams and Capron
began a rapid retreat. They rode as fast as their horses
could carry them, and only fought when there was no
escape from battle.</p>

<p>It did not take long to arrange the details of General
Stoneman’s surrender. He made it with tears in his
eyes, and he was oppressed and humiliated at this sad
and untoward ending of a campaign, which at its
commencement opened to him vistas of glory and renown.
It required but a brief while to conclude negotiations
for Stoneman’s capitulation, and the ink was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</span>
not dry upon the paper which set forth the terms, until
General Iverson, with his powers quickened and the
hopes of his men enhanced by the surrender of Stoneman,
started Breckinridge and his Kentuckians in
pursuit of the fleeing Federals, who, every moment,
became less capable of resistance or battle. He marched
his prisoners to Macon under escort. These had
expected to enter the city as conqueror; instead, they
came as dejected captives. Their dreams of glory
turned into fixed visions of failure and despair.</p>

<p>Adams and Capron, in order to avoid those behind
them, swung to the right, leaving the track which they
had traveled from fifteen to twenty-five miles west of
them, and through Eatonton and Madison and Athens
they hurried with all possible haste to find safety.
These raiders returned far more quickly than they had
come. By their detours they increased the distance,
but they increased their speed. Their tired horses were
exchanged for the mules or horses of the people of
Georgia, along the path, and they rode with exceeding
haste. Familiar with the country and spurred to highest
effort, with a desire to punish these invaders,
Breckinridge, with the Kentucky brigade, rode hard
after the fleeing Federals. A brief sleep here and there,
and with cat naps on their horses, they pushed on with
almost boundless energy, and the rearguard of the
fleeing Federals, neither night nor day, was free from
the assaults of the ragged Kentucky riders.</p>

<p>The bravest men, under such circumstances, become
more or less demoralized. These Federal soldiers
felt the depressing effect of the rout and defeat of
Stoneman, and they dropped out, sometimes in companies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</span>
and sometimes in squads, forgetting that their
only safety lay in keeping together and presenting a
bold and defiant rear to the advancing pursuers. So
rapid was the march and so fierce the pursuit that the
horses of the Confederates, even with the swapping
they were able to do along the road for fresher mounts,
either mules or horses, made their progress comparatively
slow and tedious.</p>

<p>Adams made a shorter run and escaped with half
his command. Capron veered more to the east. They
united south of Athens. On the 31st day of August
they rode with fiercest energy. Their tired steeds were
spurred and belabored to the limits of mercy. The
object was to get a few hours and some miles between
them and the men who were following, so that they
could lie down and take part of a night’s rest, preparatory
to their final spurt into Sherman’s lines. At a
little place called “Jug Tavern,” fifteen miles out from
Athens, they felt that their labors had been rewarded,
and they had enough space between them and their
pursuers to enable them to make it safe to enjoy brief
repose.</p>

<p>Colonel W. C. P. Breckinridge, who was commanding
General Williams’ Kentucky brigade, and was
foremost in pursuing Capron, realized his entire force
could not ride with such speed as would enable him to
overtake Adams and Capron. He had hung savagely
upon their rear, and also kept the inner line to Atlanta,
to drive the Federals as far east as possible; but his
horses had limitations, and Colonel Breckinridge,
with grief and apprehension, saw man after man drop
out. He beheld steed after steed with the white frost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</span>
upon its skin, which betokens the failure of its physical
vigor, lie down upon the road and refuse to move
further. Hastily assembling his entire brigade, now
numbering less than five hundred men, for review,
he had his inspector general ride down the line and order
out from the several regiments and battalions the men
who had the hardiest and freshest horses. When these
were counted they numbered only eighty-five. He
placed these under command of Lieutenant Robert
Bowles, one of his trustiest officers, and bade him ride
hard and follow the trail of Adams and Capron, and
attack them wherever and whenever found. These
eighty-five men caught the inspiration of a great opportunity,
and so cheering and yelling and waving adieu
to their comrades, whose going had been prevented by
the weariness of their mounts, they rode away. Those
left to come on by easier stages groaned in spirit as they
saw their more fortunate comrades ride away. They
cursed the fate that deprived them of the chance to win
glory in this pursuit.</p>

<p>Colonel Breckinridge told Lieutenant Bowles that
he would follow him with the remainder of the brigade,
with all possible haste; thus the eighty-five men set
out to run down their demoralized enemies.</p>

<p>Capron and Adams had finally gone to sleep on the
bank of a small stream known as Mulberry River,
which was crossed by a wooden bridge. Out in the
woods and timber the animals were tethered, and the
men laid down anywhere and everywhere, if they only
might catch a few moments’ rest. Five hundred and
fifty Federals comprised all who were left of these two
brigades. Many were dead and wounded. Scores had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</span>
been captured, as wearied they fell from their horses, on
the rapid marches they had made since leaving Macon.
Just before daybreak, on the morning of the 3d of
September, they heard the rebel yell and the sharp
crack of the revolvers resounding through their camp.
Around the outskirts of the camp a number of the
negroes, who were riding the mules and horses they
had taken from their masters, were asleep. At the
first charge of the Confederates, the mules immediately
stampeded, and with the terror-stricken negroes rushed
through the camp of the sleeping Federal soldiers.
The cries of the frightened negroes, combined with
the shouts of the attacking forces, added to the confusion
and discomfiture of the Federals. Thus rudely
aroused from their slumbers, they mounted their tired
steeds and started in a wild rush and dashed across the
bridge, along the road they believed would lead to
safety. The galloping of the steeds and the crowding
of the animals onto the wooden bridge caused it to
give way and dropped those who were passing over it
into the river below, and cut off the escape of those
who were behind. The eighty-five Confederates were
busy everywhere. The Federals were completely
demoralized. They gladly surrendered when called,
and asked for protection. They had not realized in
the darkness how small the force that had assailed and
scattered them, but without arms they were helpless,
and they were so completely exhausted that their
powers of resistance had vanished.</p>

<p>In his report Colonel Capron said, “Just before
daylight, the morning of the 3d instant, a body of the
enemy’s cavalry came up in my rear, and, as near as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</span>
can ascertain, passed around the main body of the
pickets on both flanks, striking the road where the
negroes lay. The negroes became panic-stricken and
rushed into the camp of my men, who were yet asleep
(we having been in camp about one hour and a half),
throwing them into confusion. The enemy now charged
into my camp, driving and scattering everything before
them. Every effort was made by the officers to rally
the men and check the enemy’s charge, but it was
found impossible to keep them in line, as most of them
were without arms and ammunition. Partial lines were
formed, but, owing to the confusion which ensued in
the darkness, they soon gave away. A stampede now
took place, a portion of the men rushing for the woods
and the balance running down the road and attempting
to cross a bridge over the Mulberry River, in our front.
The enemy still continued to charge my men, killing,
wounding and capturing a large number. In their rush
across the bridge it gave away, precipitating many of
them into the river. The men now scattered in every
direction. I became separated from my command,
and made my escape through the woods, arriving at
this place on the morning of the 7th instant.”</p>

<p>This combat at Jug Tavern was always held by
those who participated in it to be, considering numbers,
one of the really great victories of the war.</p>

<p>There was no chance to pass Mulberry River, into
which the bridge had fallen, and the early hours of
the morning were spent in gathering the fugitives up
and down the bank, and those hiding themselves out
in the woods, hoping to escape imprisonment. Finally
some three hundred were gathered together, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</span>
hardly had they been corralled, when General Breckinridge,
with those who had been left behind, rode up
to help their comrades who had been able to ride on
before and achieve such a great victory. Their prisoners
were marched to Athens. A great feast was prepared.
The townsfolk and country folk gathered to thank the
Kentuckians who had punished the Federal raiders.
Congratulation and gratitude were the order of the
hour. Capron, escaping on foot, found his way to the
Federal lines, but a large proportion of his force were
made prisoners, and there was hardly an organized
squad from his command left to ride the thirty miles
that intervened between them and safety, behind
Sherman’s fortifications around Atlanta.</p>

FORREST’S RAID INTO MEMPHIS,<br>
AUGUST 21, 1864</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">General Forrest, like most soldiers, had
special animosities, and one of his was General
Cadwallader Colden Washburn. It might be
said that they were men of such disposition that they
would certainly have instinctive dislike for each other.
Both were brave and extremely loyal to the Cause they
espoused, and neither saw much of good in those on
the opposite side. As they came to face each other in
Western Tennessee and Northern Mississippi, many
things occurred to increase rather than lessen their
antipathies.</p>

<p>General Washburn was born May 14th, 1818, at
Livermore, Maine. Beginning life on his father’s farm,
he had a brief experience in a country retail store, then
as schoolmaster, then emigrated west and studied law.
In Milton, Wisconsin, in 1842, he began practice. The
law was slow in that section at that period, and he became
an agent for settlers desiring to enter public
lands. He was in Congress from 1855 to 1861. Refusing
re-election, he raised a regiment of cavalry in
Wisconsin, and in October, 1861, entered active service.
He was associated with Curtis in Arkansas,
and was particularly valuable at the Battle of Grand
Coteau. In 1862 he was made brigadier general. By
November he was advanced to major general. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</span>
prominent in the siege of Vicksburg, became commander
of the Department of the Gulf, warred vigorously in
Texas, and came to be commandant at Memphis in
1864.</p>

<p>He had been instructed by General Sherman as to
the necessity of destroying Forrest. General Washburn
organized the expedition under General S. D. Sturgis,
which met such tremendous defeat at Bryce’s Cross
Roads on June 10th, 1864. He was cognizant of, and
accessory before the fact, of Sherman’s offer of promotion
to General Mower if he would pursue and kill
General Forrest. What is known as the assault of Fort
Pillow had particularly aroused feeling on General
Washburn’s part. When charged by General Forrest
with inciting the negro soldiers in his department to
refuse quarter to Forrest’s men, he parried but did not
explicitly deny what Forrest stated he had done.
Reading between the lines, it is easy to discover that
if General Washburn did not suggest or approve this
declaration of his colored troops, he was not unwilling
for them to go forth with a fixed purpose to kill without
exception such of Forrest’s cavalry as by the exigencies
and fortunes of war fell into their hands.</p>

<p>The failure of General Forrest under General Lee,
at Harrisburg in July, 1864, had rendered General
Forrest anxious to avenge his losses, and apparent defeat
there; and he resolved to give General Washburn
and his troops a real lesson in the uncertainties of war.
When A. J. Smith retreated after his victory at Harrisburg,
Forrest pursued him with his usual persistence.
General Sherman, who did a great deal of telegraphing
and seemed to have had an accurate knowledge of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</span>
conditions in West Tennessee, on the 16th of June had
wired E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War, in regard to
General Forrest, “We must destroy him if possible.”
On the same day, he telegraphed, “We must make the
people of Tennessee and Mississippi feel that although a
bold, daring and successful leader, he will bring ruin
and misery on any country where he may pass or
tarry. If we do not punish Forrest now, the whole
effect of our vast conquest will be lost.”</p>

<p>In carrying out these instructions, a large part of
the northern portion of Western Tennessee was laid
waste, and, like the Shenandoah Valley, was reduced
to the condition, over which it was boasted by Generals
Grant and Sheridan, that if a crow flew, he must take
his rations with him.</p>

<p>General Sherman also said, “I had previously
written to General Washburn that he should employ
A. J. Smith’s troops and any others that he could reach,
to pursue and if possible destroy all of Forrest’s men.”
General Sherman seemed to think more of Forrest and
his operations than he did of those who were opposing
him in his march to Atlanta.</p>

<p>When, at this time, it was proposed to give Forrest
command of all the cavalry, operating with Johnston’s
army, be it said to the credit of General Joseph Wheeler
that he endorsed General Johnston’s recommendation,
and thereby showed himself to be a man of the highest
patriotism, of transcendent nobility of character, and
of almost unparalleled devotion to the Southern Cause.
General Wheeler offered to serve under General Forrest
in any capacity Forrest might suggest. No one who
now studies General Wheeler’s campaigns can doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</span>
that he was one of the greatest soldiers the war produced,
and this proposal to serve anywhere in any
capacity under General Forrest demonstrated that his
manhood and patriotism were of the same standard
as his capacity for leadership. Ranking General Forrest,
he waived all such considerations and cheerfully
proposed to become Forrest’s lieutenant in the contemplated
assault on Sherman, and follow where Forrest
would lead.</p>

<p>In the assault on General A. J. Smith’s rear, Forrest
received a severe and painful wound. He never thought
of personal danger and was ever absolutely indifferent
to fear. Previous to the Battle of Harrisburg, General
Forrest had asked for a furlough and sought to be relieved
of his command, but this was denied him by
reason of the exigencies of the hour.</p>

<p>Harrisburg was a bitter memory to Forrest. In
that battle, three of his brigade commanders were
wounded and all the colonels were either killed or
wounded. Four miles from Tupelo at Old Town
Creek, in pursuing A. J. Smith, Forrest himself was
struck by a ball in his right foot. It was reported that
Forrest had been killed. This created intense consternation
among his own soldiers, and inexpressible joy
among his enemies. Forrest felt that in the Battle of
Harrisburg his troops had acted with supreme courage,
and on that battlefield that they did not have a fair
chance. This deeply rankled in his heart. The successes
of his previous campaigns had made him believe
that with anything like an even show his troopers were
invincible, and he dreamed of and sighed for an opportunity
to blot out the sad and bitter memories of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</span>
dreadful day, when he saw his bravest and best go down
in a conflict which was not fought according to his
judgment, nor along the lines upon which he was accustomed
to operate. After the battle, he issued a statement
in which he said, “Future generations will never
weary of hanging garlands on their graves.” Who was
responsible for Harrisburg has been the source and cause
of acute and extended criticisms. Some have said
that Forrest on that occasion failed to fight as he always
fought before and that he hesitated where hesitation
was bound to be fatal.</p>

<p>Forrest was a born leader. He had always done
best where he was the head. Subordinate, he was
restive, and he could only do his best and accomplish
most when he was supreme.</p>

<p>General Washburn had sent these several forces
after Forrest, and Forrest resolved to teach General
Washburn a lesson he would not soon forget. The
wound which General Forrest received at Old Town
Creek was one from which he never recovered fully.
After this casualty he was compelled to go in a buggy,
a plank across the dashboard holding his leg in an elevated
position, but his power as a leader lost none of
its effect from the fact that he was riding in a dilapidated
buggy rather than astride a breathing, moving,
chafing war-horse.</p>

<p>On the 20th of July, General S. D. Lee, between
whom and General Forrest there was, probably unconscious
to both of these patriotic men, some feeling, was
transferred to the army under General Hood at Atlanta,
and with the departure of Lee came General Richard
Taylor, lovingly called by his friends and his soldiers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</span>
“Dick” Taylor. He and Forrest were kindred spirits.
They looked at war through the same lenses. They were
alike brave and aggressive and restless spirits that
enjoyed the dangers and excitement of campaigns and
battles, and were not averse to strife as strife. They
were warriors by nature, and the fury of battle and the
storm of conflict had no terrors for their valiant hearts.</p>

<p>General Sherman had told his superiors that if
Forrest could be taken care of, he could handle Johnston,
and so on the 20th of July, he telegraphed General
Halleck as follows: “A. J. Smith has orders to hang
on to Forrest and prevent his coming to Tennessee.”
It was at this time that rumors came to the Federals
of the death of General Forrest. On the 2d of August,
1864, Washburn telegraphed to Sherman: “I have
a report that Forrest died some days ago of lockjaw.”
This news General Sherman reported to General Grant.
It was then that he wired Washburn, “Is Forrest surely
dead? If so, tell General Mower I am pledged to him
for his promotion, and if ‘Old Abe’ don’t make good
my promise, then General Mower can have my place.”
(Official Records, Volume 39, Part 2, page 233.)</p>

<p>Though Mower had not killed Forrest, on the 12th
of August, 1864, he received his commission as major
general, and Sherman said to Stanton: “Please convey
to the President my thanks for the commission for
General Mower, whose task was to kill Forrest. He
only crippled him; he is a young and game officer.”</p>

<p>Early in August Generals Washburn, A. J. Smith,
Mower and Grierson, by their joint effort, had concentrated
a very large force at Memphis, consisting of
ten thousand infantry, four thousand cavalry, three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</span>
thousand colored troops, and three Minnesota regiments.
The infantry of this contingent was moved
as far as possible by rail, the cavalry was marched overland,
and on the 9th of August had reached the Tallahatchie
River between Holly Springs and Oxford,
Mississippi. At that time Forrest had five thousand,
three hundred and fifty-seven men, but the tremendous
mortality among his officers had seriously impaired
the efficiency of his force. Pathetically, General Chalmers
informed General Forrest, “Both of my brigade
commanders are wounded, also a brigade commander
of General Buford’s division, and most of the field
officers of the command were either killed or wounded
in the late engagement.”</p>

<p>This advance looked formidable and sorely taxed
the genius of General Forrest to face. He was opposed
by nearly three to one. It was important to hold the
prairie country of the Mississippi, for it was prolific
of supplies. Forrest was given carte blanche by General
Maury, who was then in immediate command of
the territory to be invaded. Forrest was still unable
to ride horseback, but nevertheless he resolved to meet
his foes. General Chalmers was ordered to destroy all
the bridges on the railroad leading south from Holly
Springs. By the 14th of August, General Smith had
reached a point nearly to Oxford, Mississippi. The
force in front of Forrest was thirteen thousand infantry
and four thousand cavalry. With his small
force, now inadequately mounted, there was no hope
for him successfully in the open to fight this great
enemy. By the 18th of August Forrest had sufficiently
recovered to take to the saddle. He could only use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</span>
one foot in the stirrup. The other hung loose. The
power of no commander in the war was taxed to a
greater tension than Forrest at this moment. He dare
not face and fight his foes on the field. No courage, no
alignment with the past experiences of the Federal
commanders and the caution and care engendered by
their numerous failures could avail to halt this great
army, now organized and sent out to rout and destroy
Forrest. Numbers alone, in the field, could defeat
this well-armed, well-disciplined corps, but, alas for
Forrest, he did not have and could not get the numbers.
With only one to three in the coming expedition, the
task to most men would have appeared impossible.
Had he taken counsel of fear and even of ordinary
prudence, he would sullenly have retired before the
advance and have been content with delaying his
enemies and inflicting what loss he could by way of
unexpected assault and quick reprisal. Strategy,
skill, surprise, must now win, if winning were at all
possible.</p>

<p>Forrest sat down to unravel the difficulties of the
hour. Something must be done outside mere resistance.
The hour for that expedient alone was gone. Forrest
had something that oftentimes was better than legions.
Nature had lavishly bestowed on this untutored soldier
a something that could now and then defeat the greatest
odds, and out of apparent overwhelming adversity
win superbest victory. The thing Forrest had could
not be bought. No education could supply it. It
could only come as nature’s gift and in this supreme
hour it came to the rescue of the Confederate leader.
The moment called for a transcendent military genius,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</span>
and this gift nature had bestowed without stint upon
the unlearned but born soldier.</p>

<p>There was no lack among Forrest’s men of courage,
and upon any dangerous or difficult expedition which
he was to enter, it was not a question as to whether
his men could fight, but a question as to whether their
beasts could carry them to the point to which their
great commander had decided to move. The selection
of the best horses was now begun. All the men were
good enough, but on the work Forrest had now mapped,
a strong, dependable horse was as important as a hard,
courageous rider. Each man did his best to put his
steed upon his mettle. Every soldier was longing to go.
None knew where, save the general, but that was all
they asked, to be allowed to follow him. With sad
hearts, hundreds of the brave troopers looked on intently
while their horses were examined and condemned,
and with ill-suppressed grief heard the depressing
words, “Fall out.” Danger surely, physical weariness
certainly, mayhap death, was ahead, but every soldier
was burning to go, and when the sorrow-bringing words
came that shut out all but one in three of the corps,
a wide disappointment spread abroad in every regiment.</p>

<p>Forrest left Chalmers with four thousand men in
front of the enemy. He was ordered to persistently
attack and oppose them in every way possible, to delay
their march and to assail their flanks and communication.
Incessant rains had fallen for some days. The
roads were muddy, and the streams were full to the
banks. Forrest’s chance in the expedition which he
now undertook was dependent upon the secrecy with
which it should be consummated. If Smith knew that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</span>
he was not in front, he and Grierson and Hurlbut would
run over the small force commanded by Chalmers and
march to Vicksburg. No sooner had the sun gone down
on the 18th of August than Forrest left Oxford with
his two thousand men, the best mounted that he could
cull and select. The word to mount was anxiously
awaited. These chosen men had gone with their
leader before. It was raining furiously—had been
raining almost constantly for forty-eight hours previously.
With their soggy clothes hanging about their
drenched limbs, they were impatient to try out another
conflict, and see what glory had in stock for them in a
new encounter. The darkness of night was approaching
when, amid the thunder and downpour, these
Forrest followers sprang into their saddles, gave rein
to their steeds, and with a long drawn-out rebel yell,
set forth, defying weather, to once again contest with
their foes. Rain, floods, mud had no terror for them
where their general and duty pointed the way they must
go. Marching all night west and north, when the day
dawned, notwithstanding the conditions which faced
him, he had swung clear off the route of the Federal
Army, and was miles away before any Federal officer
or commander dreamed that Forrest was gone. Traveling
all day on the 19th and part of the night, on the
morning of the 20th he had reached Senatobia. This
was a long ride for Forrest and his followers. One
raging stream and insecure bridge were crossed, and
by courier he told Chalmers that he would soon cross
another, and, like Columbus, passing westward with
only one command, westward, westward, he was going
northward, northward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</span></p>

<p>Forrest directed Chalmers again to “Hold the enemy
and press them so as to engage and hold their attention.”
Chalmers was faithful to his trust. He fought all day—all
night—all hours, and no whisper came to the Federal
commander that Forrest was gone away. The aggressiveness
of Forrest’s lieutenant hid the mystery of his
departure within the Confederate lines.</p>

<p>General Forrest was too much of a leader not to
know that this extraordinary task which he had undertaken
could only be accomplished by rapid movement
and by concealment of his plans. In the early part of
August, in Mississippi, usually copious rains fall. The
streams at that season are almost always full. This
rendered them far more difficult to bridge and made
fording impossible. Forrest could ferry his men and
their accoutrements and ammunition and artillery,
but the horses must swim. In a pinch he might, by
rafting and swimming, get his men over the stream,
but water was a deadly foe to powder, and without
powder Forrest and his men would ride and swim in
vain. This meant delay. Delay meant defeat. But
above all, Forrest was a practical man. There was no
emergency to which his resourceful mind could not rise.
Fortunately for his plans on this occasion, the grapevine
life of Mississippi is extremely exuberant. These
vines run to the tops of the highest trees, sometimes
one hundred and fifty feet. Larger than a man’s
arms, they would send out their tendrils to the very
top of the highest trees and swinging over some limb
would spread out their branches and cover the tree
tops. These vines were flexible, almost like ropes, very
strong. Forrest undertook, as an engineer, by sending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</span>
forward his best and most intelligent troopers under
brave and energetic commanders, to find those grape
vines and use them as cables to span the river. Finding
the trees convenient to the banks of the stream, the
vines were cut down, twisted around the trees, tied as
best they could be, carried across the river, and attached
to trees on the other side. A ferry boat was placed in
the middle of the stream and anchored. Cypress and
other logs were cut into proper lengths, floated into
the stream and attached at certain distances to these
cables. At Hickahala Creek this novel bridge was first
inaugurated. Forrest was kept in close touch with
his engineers, who were constructing this strangely
fashioned pontoon. Within four or five miles from the
stream, all the cabins, houses, barns, stables and gin
houses were stripped of the flooring and shedding.
Each horseman carried on his shoulder one of these
planks. Within an hour the planks were laid, the soldiers
dismounted, each man led his horse on the boards
and crossed the stream in double file. The cables
began to stretch, and by the time all the command had
passed over, the planks had become submerged, the
water was two feet over the flooring and with difficulty
the horses could be led across. Nature seemed at this
point to be piling up insuperable obstacles in Forrest’s
path. He had truly gone seven miles when another
stream, twice as broad and equally as deep stood out
with its currents and floods to bid the Southern men
stay their march. No long drawn out planning was
necessary to figure out some way to outwit the defiance
of Cold Water River. If a sixty-foot span could be
made of grapevines, why not one of a hundred and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</span>
twenty feet, and the answer was a sharp command to
the pioneers to unsling their axes and build the required
structure. One hundred and eighty minutes under the
whip and spur of necessity saw the new bridge completed,
and the men, houses, cannon and caissons
speeding across the apparently unsafe length. The
horses were led two abreast, the guns were unlimbered
and willing hands and seasoned arms dragged them over
to the side where Forrest was pointing the way, it may
be to danger, but where glory they believed would
crown their army and enterprise with a deserved and
splendid success. This circumstance so delayed him
that on the night of the 20th he was still at Hernando,
Mississippi, twenty-five miles from Memphis. The
condition of the roads was almost indescribable. The
tramping of the horses made a foot of slush, and the
wheels of the ammunition wagons and the cannon
caissons cut deep ruts in the roads. The cavalry went
at a slow walk, and ten horses were hitched to each
piece of artillery. Notwithstanding all of these precautions,
half of Forrest’s guns had to be left at Penola.
It became apparent that they would not be carried
along with sufficient rapidity to justify Forrest in
running the risk their movement involved. Still
twenty-five miles away from Memphis, Forrest knew
he must travel all night. It was a task at which any
leader might hesitate, but now hesitation meant disaster,
and the lionhearted leader was undertaking
amongst the greatest feats he had attempted to perform.
Tremendous issues were involved. To save at
this period Northern Mississippi Territory and to prevent
the junction of General Smith’s forces with those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</span>
of General Sherman at Vicksburg was vital to the hopes
of the Confederate authorities. Rain, storm, mud,
floods, deep currents, accelerated by torrents, were the
contingencies Forrest must face, but he never had
stopped for these things before and through the darkness
of the night there was only one command, “Forward,”
“Forward,” “Forward.” It was bad enough
for those who rode. The beasts who bore the men,
weakened by the already grievous burdens laid upon
them, were spurred to speedier tramp, but hard as
were these pressed with their human loads, the awfullest
of the terrors of that terrorful night came to the dumb
sufferers who pulled the swaying gun carriages and
heavy caissons through the ruts and slush of the ever-lengthening
pathway. No cry of mercy could avail
for these speechless creations. Slashed with hickory
or oak wythes, blood streamed from their mouths
from the sawing of their bits to keep them straight in
the sunken depths of the muddy way, they passed with
indescribable suffering the horrible night. When the
limits of physical resistance they reached and no longer
left with strength or will to continue the impossible
tasks that were being laid upon them, with sullen
indifference some of these creatures, ready to die
rather than proceed another step, with a determination
born of despair, refused to make another effort and bade
defiance to their pitiless riders and drivers, who were
slashing, jerking and beating in their seemingly mad
efforts to urge forward these faithful brutes who had
done all they could to help in the effort to save the land
of those who, with apparently merciless hearts, called
for such terrible strain. Horses have wills as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</span>
men, and defying their owners, some stood still in
their tracks and no cruel blows could bring them to
move a muscle or pull an ounce. The great crisis was
ahead. If the one horse would go down another would
be harnessed, and if the led horses had all been used,
then a luckless trooper with a strong or powerful
mount was bade strip his steed, stow his equipment on
a gun carriage or caisson, and take his chances farther
on to win from his enemies a something to ride, which
the exigencies of the hour had taken away from him.
The new team took up the burdens their predecessors
had laid down, and the sullen horse was led out into
the woods, or now and then, fearing that he might prove
of value to the enemy, a shot was fired into his heart
to end his sufferings or to destroy that which by some
possibility might some day aid those who were fighting
the cause for which he had met so violent a death.</p>

<p>Forrest had intended to strike Memphis on Sunday
morning. One-fourth of all of his horses had broken
down under the tremendous strain to which they had
been subjected. There were no horses left in the country,
the Federals and the Confederates had taken them
all, and the dismounted men, dejected, sad and disappointed,
were compelled on foot to retrace their steps
along the paths which they had come.</p>

<p>There were three generals in Memphis that Forrest
particularly desired to capture, Generals C. C. Washburn,
Stephen A. Hurlbut and R. P. Buckland. They
were scattered over different parts of the city. By
three o’clock General Forrest had reached the limits
of the city, called his troops around him, and gave to
each commander accurate and definite instructions as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</span>
to what would be done. Scout after scout returned
to bring the details of the Federal positions, and even
citizens, to whom had been secretly and silently conveyed
the news of the coming, slipped by the Federal
sentinels to tell Forrest all he needed to know of his
enemies’ whereabouts, in order to make surprise and
capture sure. Above all, it was earnestly impressed
on the squads who rode into the city that there was to
be no shouting, no cheering, no battle cry, and that
not a gun must be fired under any circumstances. The
leaders were told that if they met any Federal troops
they were to ignore them, to be extremely careful,
bring on no battle and engage in no fighting, but to
rush forward over all that opposed.</p>

<p>Forrest’s brother, William H., had often rendered
most valiant and efficient service to his brother. He
had selected with great care forty scouts. These were
as reckless and as brave as their captain. They were
to advance, capture the pickets, and without waiting
for the balance of the men to ride at full speed to the
Gayoso hotel, surround it and prevent the escape of
General Hurlbut. Forrest had learned accurately the
position of the Illinois infantry. They were stationed
at a place close to the road along which Forrest must
pass.</p>

<p>Colonel Longwood was to follow Captain William
Forrest. Upon reaching a prominent place in the city,
he was to station a portion of his troops as a reserve,
and the balance were to proceed to the wharf and capture
any transports that might be there. To his
younger brother, Colonel Jesse Forrest, General Forrest
assigned one of the most important and difficult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</span>
things to be accomplished. He was allowed to choose
his own associates. The service would be furious,
fierce, reckless, dangerous. He was to ride straight
to the house of General Washburn on Union Street,
which had been located carefully by General Forrest,
who knew Memphis as well as he knew his plantation,
and Jesse Forrest was to effect the capture of General
C. C. Washburn. It makes one tremble almost half a
century after this occurrence to realize the sensation
of these men, however brave, as they engaged in this
wonderful enterprise. Forrest decided with Colonel
T. H. Bell and detachments of Newsom’s, Russell’s and
Barteau’s regiments, and the two pieces of artillery
under Lieutenant Sale, to remain in the suburbs,
believing that it would be necessary for these brave
and adventuresome spirits who had gone to the city
on this reckless mission to have support and backing
when they returned. Forrest felt that it was hardly
possible for all of the three parties he had sent into the
city to successfully accomplish their respective missions
and then come out without much loss or possible
defeat. He hoped that the boldness of his movements
and the recklessness of the execution would terrorize
and paralyze his foes, but even he doubted if all could
emerge without some failure.</p>

<p>The day was just beginning to break when the detachments
all moved forward. The morning was foggy
and a pall of darkness hung over the scene of operations.
Captain William Forrest, with ten men well in advance,
rode along the line designated for his approach, and,
challenged by the Federal sentry, replied that he was a
detachment of a Missouri regiment with rebel prisoners.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</span>
He was ordered to dismount, but instead he rode up
to the sentinel, who suspected nothing when Captain
Forrest had cried out, “All right,” and supposed that
he had dismounted. As soon as Captain Forrest could
discern the form of the picket, sticking his spurs into
his horse’s flanks, he caused him to spring forward, and
then using his pistol as a bludgeon, he knocked the
Federal trooper unconscious to the ground. Forrest
directed his companions to follow him instantly, and
charged upon the reserve pickets, but one of these was
enabled to fire his gun before they were surrounded,
and this one shot saved the Federals great loss and
deprived the expedition of some of its results.</p>

<p>There was nothing now left but to ride recklessly
and rapidly into the heart of the city. The Rubicon
was crossed. The die was cast. The thrill and enthusiasm
of the dangerous work in which they were
engaged so stirred the hearts of the men that they forgot
their orders and instead of obeying the directions of
their commander as to complete silence, they began
vociferously to give the rebel yell.</p>

<p>Near the Gayoso hotel, Captain Forrest came suddenly
upon a Federal battery of six pieces. This he
charged, and the artillerists, driven from their guns,
sough refuge in buildings in proximity to the battery.
The Confederates were in such a hurry that they failed
to have done what would have afterwards been a very
valuable thing—spike the guns.</p>

<p>It did not take Captain William Forrest long to
reach the Gayoso hotel. He rode into the corridor,
and his men were placed around the building so as to
prevent the escape of General Hurlbut. Fortunately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</span>
for General Hurlbut, that night he slept out and when
Colonel Chalmers battered upon the door, it was opened
by a beautiful young woman who pleaded for protection,
but alas Hurlbut was gone.</p>

<p>Colonel Jesse Forrest rode with great celerity,
but the unfortunate discharge of the gun of the picket
had given warning, and a Federal cavalryman of the
6th Illinois regiment rode swiftly up to General Washburn’s
house, beat upon the door with his sabre, and
cried out that Forrest’s cavalry were in possession of
the town and were in sight of the house, moving for
Washburn’s capture. General Washburn did not even
take time to dress, but fled away in his night clothes
through the alleys from the back door, across the garden,
and running half a mile found safety in the fort.
A Federal lieutenant, W. H. Thurston, in his official
report, said, “The general ran away for a safe place
in the fort, which was fully a half mile from his home,
when he was but three squares away from the provost
marshal’s office; and all this without giving any orders
or commands as to what should be done by the troops.”
All that Colonel Forrest got of the general’s belongings
was a uniform and some personal effects, which he
brought to his brother, the general, and which the next
day were returned with Forrest’s compliments under a
flag of truce. That war is not without its courtesies is
shown by the fact that two or three weeks later, General
Washburn returned these compliments by sending
to General Forrest a full, complete, handsome uniform
of a Confederate major general.</p>

<p>The detachments which had been assigned to the
capture of General Buckland also arrived too late.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_620">[Pg 620]</span>
The unfortunate enthusiastic yells of the Confederates,
and an occasional shot from rifles, alarmed the sentinel
who watched Buckland’s house, and the general,
hastily and negligently dressed, sought safety at some
other point.</p>

<p>Memphis at this time was garrisoned by about five
thousand men, combining a mingling of cavalry,
infantry and artillery. There was little left to do but to
search in the stables and get all the horses and capture
all the prisoners possible. The detachments which had
been scattered in the city now found it wise and prudent
to retreat. The battery which they had captured was
again manned and turned loose upon them. Without
questioning whether it was wise or unwise, the Confederates
rode at the gunners and dispersed them,
killing or wounding twenty of their number, and thus
were enabled to avoid further trouble from this quarter.
As there were no horses convenient, they could not
carry the pieces away. By this time they were glad
enough to get away themselves. Only when they came
to retire did they realize the hazard and peril of the
enterprise in which they had taken part. Its audacity
appalled the participants when they fully took in the
extent of the dangers through which they had passed
and of the all nigh incalculable risks they had assumed.</p>

<p>General Forrest was now ready to retire. He felt
sure his mission had been accomplished. Smith in
Mississippi did not want Forrest in Memphis, one hundred
miles in his rear. Sherman or no Sherman, the
capture of Memphis would be an immeasurable calamity.
No commander could safely forecast what Forrest
would or could do. Rains, floods, mud-filled roads,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_621">[Pg 621]</span>
seemed no barrier to this wonderful man of war, and
to leave him alone in West Tennessee with two thousand
daring followers filled the minds of the Federal commander
with apprehension and his heart with dread.
Twice he had an engagement to make a junction with
Sherman’s forces at Meridian, but when he made that
agreement, he had not dreamed that Forrest would
turn on Memphis, force the commanders there to flee
in their night clothes into the forts, and his horsemen
ride through its streets capturing, killing and destroying
all that came in their paths from daybreak until
nine in the morning.</p>

<p>In the depths of their souls they cried out against
the conditions that made them face the ubiquitous
and impossible Confederate leader. No man’s reputation
was safe who was sent against this redoubtable
chief. He came when he was not expected, he fought
against any sort of odds. Nature could pile up
against him no obstacles that could thwart his will,
and to them he went and came as he planned, and no
human foresight could avail against his strategy or his
onslaughts.</p>

<p>It was a humiliating thing for General Smith to do,
but he was stirred by this strange happening. If he
went on, Forrest might undo all a year’s planning and
garrisoning had done and West Tennessee again become
Confederate territory. If he went back along
the line he had come, he must march on roads, the
very sight of which made cavalry wish they had never
come to war. The Federal commander debated earnestly
and long. He talked with his associates and then
resolved to turn his face northward, forego the meeting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</span>
at Meridian and save what Forrest had left in his trail
to Memphis.</p>

<p>When Forrest learned definitely what General
Smith had determined to do, he rejoiced with exceeding
great joy. He felt that his work was not in vain.
He had not destroyed the army that was capable of
inflicting immeasurable injury upon his country, but
he had caused it to withdraw and stayed for a while
the impending blow which, had it fallen, would have
brought down with it all hopes of maintaining any
great Confederate force between Atlanta and the
Mississippi River. The consciousness of having delayed
the inevitable, if only for a few weeks or months,
was a source of profound satisfaction to the man who
in the past summer had done more constant, difficult
fighting than any officer who wore the gray.</p>

<p>As they marched away, a portion of the 6th Illinois
Cavalry under Colonel Starr viciously assaulted the
Confederate rearguard. As Forrest was always at
the post of danger, he was on hand there. They were
so close together that in the charge Colonel Starr and
General Forrest engaged in a hand-to-hand encounter,
and the Federal commander was seriously wounded
and rendered unfit for further battle. A short distance
away from Memphis, General Forrest sent back a flag
of truce, proposing the exchange of prisoners and telling
General Washburn that a number of his officers had
been captured and were without clothing, and informed
General Washburn that he would wait at Nonoonah
Creek for a reply. When General Forrest arrived there
he found a note from General Washburn, stating that
he had no authority to exchange prisoners, but that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</span>
he would be very glad if General Forrest would allow
his officers to have the clothing which he sent with
his note. General Forrest was ready to be humane.
The half-clad, bare-footed soldiers touched his sympathies.
He had no reason to love General Washburn
and those he commanded, but he had such profound
satisfaction in the work of the night in Memphis that
it softened his animosities and he cheerfully did all that
he could to mitigate the woes of his unfortunate and
dejected captives, who, now six hundred in number,
were encountering woes and hardships that touched
the hearts of even the foes, some of whom had urged
negro soldiers to give no quarter to Forrest’s men.
Those least able to travel were paroled and turned
loose, while the stronger and best clad were kept for
yet another day of marching. It was during this march
that General Forrest skillfully and craftily managed
to get some supplies for his nearly famished men. In
Memphis, the work was too fierce for food contemplation,
and when some miles from the city, hunger began
to assert its claims with no provisions to meet its
outcry, General Forrest then despatched a flag of truce
to say to General Washburn that if he would not accept
Confederate parole, he would at least feed those he was
forcing him to carry away as prisoners on a trying and
debilitating march. Two wagon loads of supplies were
sent by the Federal commander in response to this
appeal, and it pleased General Forrest greatly to see
that after giving his prisoners all the rations they could
consume or carry, there was enough to shut out hunger
in his command for at least thirty-six hours.</p>

<p>Here, eager marching was the order of the day.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_624">[Pg 624]</span>
There was nothing now between Forrest and Smith.
He had a wide country in which to operate. The
streams were full and the roads were bad, but these
same difficulties would face his enemies.</p>

<p>There was no telegraphic communication; Chalmers
was anxiously waiting news from Forrest and so,
to relieve his anxiety and distress, at Hernando he
despatched a courier with a message stating, “I attacked
Memphis at four o’clock this morning, driving the
enemy to his fortifications. We killed and captured
four hundred, taking their entire camp, with about
three hundred horses and mules. Washburn and staff
escaped in the darkness of the early morning, Washburn
leaving his clothes behind.”</p>

<p>The prisoners were cumbersome. Prisoners are
not a good asset on a trip like this, and so Forrest
paroled them and proceeded on his march to Panola,
where he arrived on the 22d of August.</p>

<p>Forrest was not altogether without some apprehension
as to what his enemy might do in case they
heard that Forrest had gone, and so from Panola he
sent the swiftest courier he could find with the following
message to Chalmers: “If the enemy is falling
back, pursue them hard. Send Buford to capture their
foraging parties. Keep close to their camp. Order
Captain Henderson to scout well to their right to ascertain
if there is any movement this way.” Forrest told
him in addition that he would rest for two or three
days at Grenada, if possible.</p>

<p>By the 23d of August General Smith had paused
in his advance into Mississippi. Smith had turned
around. The strategy and genius of Forrest was too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</span>
much for him and so he retreated north from Mississippi
and left Forrest a clear way to his friends and comrades.
Forrest was able to telegraph to General Maury on the
29th: “Enemy left Holly Springs at two o’clock yesterday,
marching rapidly in the direction of Memphis
and La Grange. They say they are ordered to reinforce
Sherman.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">In the preparation of these sketches I have relied greatly
upon Dr. John Allen Wyeth’s “Life of General Forrest,”
one of the most entertaining war books ever published;
General Basil W. Duke’s “Morgan and His Men”; Major
H. B. McClelland’s “Life and Campaigns of Major General
J. E. B. Stuart”; “Hampton and His Cavalry,” by Colonel
Edward L. Wells; “Shelby and His Men,” by Major John N.
Edwards; “Campaigns of Wheeler and His Cavalry,”
edited by W. C. Dodson, and published under the auspices
of Wheeler’s Confederate Cavalry Association; “Confederate
Military History”; Captain John W. Morton’s “Artillery
of N. B. Forrest’s Cavalry,” and the compilations of
official records of the Union and Confederate Armies, published
by the United States Government.</p>

<p>This last work is one of the most remarkable of its kind
ever issued by any government. It contains all despatches,
letters and reports of every kind, bearing upon the conduct
of the war. It tells, day by day, in the words of the actors,
the events which were taking place in the four years’ struggle.
In these contemporary writings, those who were carrying
on this mighty struggle speak for themselves, and they
furnish the historian with the most truthful and accurate
accounts of what those who were engaged in the bitter war
were doing or thought they were doing each day.</p>

<p>Governor Joseph D. Sayers and General W. T. Hart, of
Texas, have been most generous in giving me data concerning
items dealing with Texas troops. Dr. John A. Lewis
of the 9th Kentucky Cavalry and Major A. E. Richards,
Second in Mosby’s Command, and General Theodore S.
Garnett of Virginia and Colonel J. Will Hall of Missouri have
laboriously and thoroughly perused copy and made many
valuable suggestions. Captain H. H. Mathews of Breathed’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</span>
Battery, Stuart’s Artillery, sent accounts of many things
that were new concerning the campaigns of Stuart.</p>

<p>The principal agency used by General Hampton in
securing information for the cattle raid of September, 1864,
was Colonel George D. Shadburn. His courage, intelligence
and energy secured the most important facts necessary for
the movements of General Hampton’s forces, and in the
pursuit his valor and intrepidity won the highest commendation
of his commander. Colonel Shadburn still survives,
and lives in San Francisco, California.</p>

<p>Captain O. F. Redd of Lexington, Kentucky, sent valuable
data about the campaigns of Shelby and Marmaduke.
I am particularly indebted to Rev. R. Excell Fry of Gadsden,
Alabama, for investigations and report about Forrest’s
pursuit of Streight. Mr. W. P. Lay of Gadsden, Alabama,
has rendered the South his debtor for investigating important
matters concerning Forrest’s pursuit and capture of Streight.
He secured from John H. Wisdom the facts of his great ride
from Gadsden to Rome, in his effort to head off Colonel
Streight. Without his help, it would have been impossible
to have secured the facts of the wonderful performance of
this patriotic Alabamian. Colonel Henry George and
General H. A. Tyler have furnished me much new matter
in regard to the Battle of Bryce’s Cross Roads.</p>

<p>In no case have I completed a chapter without referring
it to one or more soldiers who participated in the events
undertaken to be described. To General Basil W. Duke,
Colonel William A. Milton and General John B. Castleman,
and to Governor James B. McCreary I acknowledge my
obligation, for not only facts but timely suggestions.</p>

<p>The preparation of this book has been a work of love.
It has cost immense labor and much of ease and time. But
for the industry and patience of my secretary, Miss Mary
McNamara, I could not have prepared the manuscript or
made the investigation necessary to write this book. I am
deeply indebted to Mr. Logan N. Rock and Mr. S. G. Tate,
my associates in the practice of law, and to George T. and
Mrs. Settle for proofreading and correction.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
